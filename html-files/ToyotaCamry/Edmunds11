While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Camry is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Camry has a 7.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Camry is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can cover miles with ease with available cruise control. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling.

I was approved thru my credit union at a lower rate than what Carvana offered and my credit union mailed me my check. Carvana sold the vehicle while I was processing my purchase and I ended up buying another truck locally at a dealer. On Black Friday I tried to give them another chance and tried to purchase a Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagen for my son. I filled out all the bank info with a $2000 deposit and the balance $12000 would come from my credit union. I signed all the paperwork online and scheduled a delivery date for 2 weeks later. 3 days after my online purchase, I kept getting texts stating that I would lose the $1000 Black Friday discount if they didn&#x27;t have a copy of my check from the credit union sent over to them by 8pm that evening. I had already provided Carvana with my credit union information, account, as well as authorized them to verify my fund for both the deposit and the balance. They stated some bogus &quot;guideline in underwriting,&quot; that this wasn&#x27;t enough. So I said no problem, in the morning, we can get on a 3 way call and speak to both my bank and my credit union and they can provide verification. They said unfortunately, the price would go up $1000 if this was the case as there was an expiration date on the black Friday discount. I even offered, a screen shot of my credit union account, showing my loan was already funded via a check and my first payment was due in January, but they still said this was not acceptable. It seems they make it hard for you to complete a transaction with a discount and wanted to revert back to a no discount transaction stating there was not enough time to verify funds (really? I didn&#x27;t set up delivery for 2 weeks exactly because I knew it would take time for my credit union to mail me a check). Their customer service rep Ally escalated the conversation to TJ her &quot;manager&quot; who was very smug and thought that when he strutted his &quot;manager&quot; title I would be impressed. I explained that I was buying from Carvana for the &quot;convenience and hassle free process they claim to have&quot; but yet will not hold a car even with a $2000 deposit for more than 24 hours unless you finance though them and since you are using a &quot;3rd party&quot; credit union (that has much lower rates than them for folks with great credit), their guidelines were different. To me it was simply a bait and switch, &quot;buy at this price one day but the price will change a few days later after they had extracted all your personal financial information. Never again. I requested they cancel my order. Their prices are the same as car dealerships and as much as some folks think dealerships are tough to deal with, Carvana employs people who know nothing about customer service. There is no advantage in buying from them than from a dealership. In fact I would much rather deal with real people whom I can evaluate if they are trustworthy and be able to choose to do business with them or not. The fact that they are an internet dealership only empowers them to hide in anonymity when they try to treat you unscrupulously. Do yourself a favor buy your next vehicle the old fashioned way, find someone who you can meet in person and trust. Buying a car are stressful to some, Carvana will only make you more stressful and offer no advantage in pricing or service. If this is how you are treated when you are trying to buy a vehicle from them, imagine what will happen if there is a problem with your car/truck! Poor service in the beginning will translate to worse service when you need it. I hope you read all the other negative reviews on Yelp and other rating sites and see Carvana for what it really is.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2017<!-- --> <!-- -->Toyota<!-- --> <!-- -->Camry<!-- --> <!-- -->LE<!-- --> with USB Inputs, Tire Pressure Warning, Rear Bench Seats, Audio and cruise controls on steering wheel, Stability Control<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>27<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->24<!-- --> City/<!-- -->33<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->08-14-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-4T1BF1FK3HU743984" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-4T1BF1FK3HU743984" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="1889606" data-dealer-rooftop-id="1889605" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2016 Toyota Camry LE in White" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/toyota/camry/2016/vin/4T1BF1FK5GU246269/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/04-4t1bf1fk5gu246269/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2016 Toyota Camry LE in White" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="4T1BF1FK5GU246269" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/toyota/camry/2016/vin/4T1BF1FK5GU246269/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2016<!-- --> <!-- -->Toyota<!-- --> <!-- -->Camry<!-- --> <!-- -->LE</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(250, 250, 250)" title="Exterior Color: Super White" aria-label="Exterior Color: Super White"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(60, 60, 60)" title="Interior Color: Black cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Black cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">36,202 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="0 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span></span> (<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</span></div><div class="d-inline-block bg-gray-extra-light small px-0_25 text-gray-darker"><span class="icon-transit mr-0_25"></span> <!-- -->Delivery Available<sup>*</sup></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->2000395839</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$15,400</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

My delivery has been postponed 3 times, and will be postponed for 4th time after I call them to file complaint on my nightmare, Lisa!! 

Lisa has been the most [non-permissible content removed] dealer employee I&#x27;ve encountered, contacted, mssg in the 3 1/2 months on mkt to buy a vehicle thus far!!! She called me twice, mad?? She canceled the 3rd delivery, demanding I re-sign another contract by noon, not taking into consideration that I cannot function physically until or after 3 p.m. 

My vehicle was scheduled to be delivered until 4:30 p.m. Driver advised me on first embarrassing delivery that as long as contract was signed during delivery, and I had proof that purchased vehicle was on auto insurance policy, he&#x27;d leave my car!! I did add it to my auto insurance policy to start by date given, only to find that they never brought the car on that day!! Now I have to go through the troubles to get it off!! 

Driver was rude, late, and brought car to me at dark, and don&#x27;t even carry an I pad for customers to e-sign, in case contract not retrievable online to customer!! He was yelling across the street my business and personal information to me!! What was most humiliating was that he brought down the vehicle, with my neighbors watching, to later take it and put it back on flatbed!!! 

I had purchased the vehicle in full!! The funds were verified with my credit union, which took an hour and 3 attemps due to their lack of organization!! Beware of your MONEY!!! If this happened to me when I was paying for the Mercedes, CASH and in full, imagine with financing!!! It only means that due to their negligence and discrimination against a Disabled, Gay Hispanic, they are only setting Carvana up for lawsuits!!! 

All of this occurred to me before signing their e-contract!! I&#x27;d rather have received my paid in full vehicle in a timely manner as they advertise, then to seek legal remedy!!! My recommendation to the wise and public is, if you are Disabled, Gay or Hispanic, and you want to buy a car from CARVANA is have time for haggling, discrimination and racism!!! </p><p class="small

I got there earlier than my set time and Jose had someone else work with me instead of making me wait or having to come back which I appreciated very much. Marcus was very knowledgeable and took me on a test drive with the car I liked best.  That day I didn&#x27;t decide on a car right away but I liked that Marcus called to followed up with me without making me feel hounded.  When I finally went back in Jose was available this time and took his time to LISTEN to what I really wanted and was able to point out a few cars that I would like.  ***Let&#x27;s just say I ended up leaving that day with my new car.***

Truly guys, Enterprise is the way to go. They take really good care of their cars and you never have to guess if your car will clunk out on you once you leave the lot.

Upon calling initially,  I was greeted by Yuleidys Pavon who provided me with some more information of the car I was viewing on the website and let me know that I could go and see it the same day if I wanted to. Upon arriving at the dealership I was welcomed and greeted by her where she led me to the car and paired me up with the salesman Hector Gonzalez who was very active in ensuring that any questions or needs we had were answered and tended to.  I&#x27;d like to thank all of the staff, but more specifically the two individuals that helped me with my purchase at Kendall Toyota for doing their best in making sure that our experience was a good one.

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without ever stepping foot inside a dealership! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Camry is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Camry has a 7.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Camry is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can cover miles with ease with available cruise control. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Jason and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer&#x27;s remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn&#x27;t live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we&#x27;ll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase. Have a question about the car you&#x27;re looking at, or about the purchase process in general? Visit us at Carvana.com to learn more!</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Dealer Review:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Every person working at carvana, with the exception of Crystal in underwriting and Tracy in Executive Team, have all been mad, negligent, racist, unknowledgeable, unprofessional, and discriminating in the upper mgt level!! My delivery has been postponed 3 times, and will be postponed for 4th time after I call them to file complaint on my nightmare, Lisa!! 

Lisa has been the most [non-permissible content removed] dealer employee I&#x27;ve encountered, contacted, mssg in the 3 1/2 months on mkt to buy a vehicle thus far!!! She called me twice, mad?? She canceled the 3rd delivery, demanding I re-sign another contract by noon, not taking into consideration that I cannot function physically until or after 3 p.m. 

My vehicle was scheduled to be delivered until 4:30 p.m. Driver advised me on first embarrassing delivery that as long as contract was signed during delivery, and I had proof that purchased vehicle was on auto insurance policy, he&#x27;d leave my car!! I did add it to my auto insurance policy to start by date given, only to find that they never brought the car on that day!! Now I have to go through the troubles to get it off!! 

Driver was rude, late, and brought car to me at dark, and don&#x27;t even carry an I pad for customers to e-sign, in case contract not retrievable online to customer!! He was yelling across the street my business and personal information to me!! What was most humiliating was that he brought down the vehicle, with my neighbors watching, to later take it and put it back on flatbed!!! 

I had purchased the vehicle in full!! The funds were verified with my credit union, which took an hour and 3 attemps due to their lack of organization!! Beware of your MONEY!!! If this happened to me when I was paying for the Mercedes, CASH and in full, imagine with financing!!! It only means that due to their negligence and discrimination against a Disabled, Gay Hispanic, they are only setting Carvana up for lawsuits!!! 

All of this occurred to me before signing their e-contract!! I&#x27;d rather have received my paid in full vehicle in a timely manner as they advertise, then to seek legal remedy!!! My recommendation to the wise and public is, if you are Disabled, Gay or Hispanic, and you want to buy a car from CARVANA is have time for haggling, discrimination and racism!!! </p><p class="small

Our sales representative was courteous and professional. There was so haggling, no stress, no pushiness at all. Our loan was pre-approved via our CU and linked into Enterprise&#x27;s system. The whole thing was seamless. The only problem we had was that we were given an incorrect key and there was some delay in rectifying this because of the holidays. We love our new car and the service we received from Enterprise Car Sales.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2018<!-- --> <!-- -->Toyota<!-- --> <!-- -->Camry<!-- --> <!-- -->SE<!-- --> with Tire Pressure Warning, Audio and cruise controls on steering wheel, Pre-collision safety system, Stability Control, Auto Climate Control<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>32<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->28<!-- --> City/<!-- -->39<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->08-26-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-4T1B11HK0JU576940" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-4T1B11HK0JU576940" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="824922" data-dealer-rooftop-id="824921" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2018 Toyota Camry LE in Gray" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/toyota/camry/2018/vin/4T1B11HK3JU125243/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/55-4t1b11hk3ju125243/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2018 Toyota Camry LE in Gray" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="4T1B11HK3JU125243" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/toyota/camry/2018/vin/4T1B11HK3JU125243/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2018<!-- --> <!-- -->Toyota<!-- --> <!-- -->Camry<!-- --> <!-- -->LE</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(93, 91, 96)" title="Exterior Color: Predawn Gray Mica" aria-label="Exterior Color: Predawn Gray Mica"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(0, 0, 0)" title="Interior Color: Black cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Black cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">40,904 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="5 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span></span> (<!-- -->2<!-- -->)</span></div><div class="d-inline-block bg-gray-extra-light small px-0_25 text-gray-darker"><span class="icon-transit mr-0_25"></span> <!-- -->Delivery Available<sup>*</sup></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->7Q9K4K</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$18,799</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without ever stepping foot inside a dealership! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Camry is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Camry has a 7.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Camry is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can also avoid any issues with a lead foot by engaging the cruise control on this Camry. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling.

Bought it with 5 miles on it.  On the way home the shifting lag became pronounced.  Acceleration was jerky and the lag made it dangerous.  Went back to Toyota Irvine Service dept. Which was a nightmare in &amp; of itself. They were no help, rude and 4 hours later they told me it was normal. Offered us to test drive another and see that</span><span class="sr-only"> they are all that way. After zero help from Toyota I tried anything and everything to fix the issues. It turns out the lag and jerky shifting is due to the traction control system.  If you turn off traction control using the button on the dashboard left of the steering  wheel. The car drives how you expect a Camry should. It shifts smoothly and has a more aggressive acceleration response.  I just want Toyota to come up with a permanent solution so I don&#x27;t have to disable traction control each time I start the car.</span></div><div class="col-12"><button type="button"

I was approved thru my credit union at a lower rate than what Carvana offered and my credit union mailed me my check. Carvana sold the vehicle while I was processing my purchase and I ended up buying another truck locally at a dealer. On Black Friday I tried to give them another chance and tried to purchase a Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagen for my son. I filled out all the bank info with a $2000 deposit and the balance $12000 would come from my credit union. I signed all the paperwork online and scheduled a delivery date for 2 weeks later. 3 days after my online purchase, I kept getting texts stating that I would lose the $1000 Black Friday discount if they didn't have a copy of my check from the credit union sent over to them by 8pm that evening. I had already provided Carvana with my credit union information, account, as well as authorized them to verify my fund for both the deposit and the balance. They stated some bogus \"guideline in underwriting,\" that this wasn't enough. So I said no problem, in the morning, we can get on a 3 way call and speak to both my bank and my credit union and they can provide verification. They said unfortunately, the price would go up $1000 if this was the case as there was an expiration date on the black Friday discount. I even offered, a screen shot of my credit union account, showing my loan was already funded via a check and my first payment was due in January, but they still said this was not acceptable. It seems they make it hard for you to complete a transaction with a discount and wanted to revert back to a no discount transaction stating there was not enough time to verify funds (really? I didn't set up delivery for 2 weeks exactly because I knew it would take time for my credit union to mail me a check). Their customer service rep Ally escalated the conversation to TJ her \"manager\" who was very smug and thought that when he strutted his \"manager\" title I would be impressed. I explained that I was buying from Carvana for the \"convenience and hassle free process they claim to have\" but yet will not hold a car even with a $2000 deposit for more than 24 hours unless you finance though them and since you are using a \"3rd party\" credit union (that has much lower rates than them for folks with great credit), their guidelines were different. To me it was simply a bait and switch, \"buy at this price one day but the price will change a few days later after they had extracted all your personal financial information. Never again. I requested they cancel my order. Their prices are the same as car dealerships and as much as some folks think dealerships are tough to deal with, Carvana employs people who know nothing about customer service. There is no advantage in buying from them than from a dealership. In fact I would much rather deal with real people whom I can evaluate if they are trustworthy and be able to choose to do business with them or not. The fact that they are an internet dealership only empowers them to hide in anonymity when they try to treat you unscrupulously. Do yourself a favor buy your next vehicle the old fashioned way, find someone who you can meet in person and trust. Buying a car are stressful to some, Carvana will only make you more stressful and offer no advantage in pricing or service. If this is how you are treated when you are trying to buy a vehicle from them, imagine what will happen if there is a problem with your car/truck! Poor service in the beginning will translate to worse service when you need it. I hope you read all the other negative reviews on Yelp and other rating sites and see Carvana for what it really is."},{"thirdPartyInfo":{"priceValidation":{}},"vid":"BDEE30E42284AC769C95F4B698B8BAFC","vin":"4T1BF1FK5GU246269","stockNumber":"2000395839","type":"USED","sellersComments":"Got your eye on a 2016 Toyota Camry that seats 5 and gets 35 MPG?

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without ever stepping foot inside a dealership! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Camry is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Camry has a 7.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Camry is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground.

The funds were verified with my credit union, which took an hour and 3 attemps due to their lack of organization!! Beware of your MONEY!!! If this happened to me when I was paying for the Mercedes, CASH and in full, imagine with financing!!! It only means that due to their negligence and discrimination against a Disabled, Gay Hispanic, they are only setting Carvana up for lawsuits!!! \n\nAll of this occurred to me before signing their e-contract!! I'd rather have received my paid in full vehicle in a timely manner as they advertise, then to seek legal remedy!!! My recommendation to the wise and public is, if you are Disabled, Gay or Hispanic, and you want to buy a car from CARVANA is have time for haggling, discrimination and racism!!!

This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Camry is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground.

solved!!!","text":"Test drive was fine, but it was basically all freeway. Bought it with 5 miles on it.  On the way home the shifting lag became pronounced.  Acceleration was jerky and the lag made it dangerous.  Went back to Toyota Irvine Service dept. Which was a nightmare in & of itself. They were no help, rude and 4 hours later they told me it was normal. Offered us to test drive another and see that they are all that way. After zero help from Toyota I tried anything and everything to fix the issues. It turns out the lag and jerky shifting is due to the traction control system.  If you turn off traction control using the button on the dashboard left of the steering  wheel. The car drives how you expect a Camry should. It shifts smoothly and has a more aggressive acceleration response.  I just want Toyota to come up with a permanent solution so I don't have to disable traction control each time I start the car.
