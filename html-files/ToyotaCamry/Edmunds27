Your buying risks are reduced thanks to a CARFAX BuyBack Guarantee. The Camry 4dr Sdn I4 Auto SE has been lightly driven and there is little to no wear and tear on this vehicle. The care taken on this gently used vehicle is reflective of the 31,361mi put on this Toyota. There is no reason why you shouldn&#x27;t buy this Toyota Camry 4dr Sdn I4 Auto SE. It is incomparable for the price and quality. The Toyota Camry has been the best-selling car in America for twelve years now. The Camry is a massive success and with good reason -- it&#x27;s got proven reliability, a quiet and spacious interior, good fuel economy and exciting exterior styling. For anyone who needs quiet, comfortable transportation for up to five people without breaking the bank, the Camry is invariably the place to start the search. The Camry offers a ton of versatility for the price, but can also be optioned up to give buyers that luxury car feel if they so desire.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Dealer Review:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Recently my wife and I were window shopping on Sunday at Island auto group Toyota.
We really were not looking to buy right away ,we were just looking for a future purchase! However, the outstanding customer service and the fantastic deal that we received from salesmen Francis A. was so outstanding that we walked out with a New Toyota Tacoma truck,correction I, should say we drove off in a new Toyota Truck!

The other dealerships I visited did not take me seriously as a purchaser because I still had 8 payments left on the lease on my car, despite me telling them I could purchase at any time. I spoke with one of the managers when I first got to the dealership because I wanted a salesperson that wouldn&#x27;t tick me off as I have several years of experience in car sales and as finance manager and I know how a customer should be treated. Mike Gerreine was my salesman and he was wonderful!  He took me seriously as a female looking to purchase a pickup truck. While I decided the Ranger wasn&#x27;t for me Mike showed me a 3.5 EcoBoost F-150 that I loved and ended up buying. It just so happens the exact vehicle I bought was at one of the other dealerships I had visited before coming to Northgate Ford and Mike was happy to get it for me. The dealership gave me a strong offer on my Honda Civic that I traded in ultimately.  The whole process was smooth with no pressure to buy a new vehicle or trade in my car which I appreciated.  I highly recommend my salesman Mike Gerrein and Northgate Ford if you are looking for a new vehicle!</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2018<!-- --> <!-- -->Toyota<!-- --> <!-- -->Camry<!-- --> <!-- -->XSE<!-- --> with Stability Control, Auto Climate Control, Adaptive Cruise Control, Power Driver Seat, Trip Computer<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>32<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->28<!-- --> City/<!-- -->39<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->07-25-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-4T1B61HK9JU527463" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-4T1B61HK9JU527463" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="1817877" data-dealer-rooftop-id="1817876" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2011 Toyota Camry LE in Silver" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/toyota/camry/2011/vin/4T4BF3EK2BR138512/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/a7-4t4bf3ek2br138512/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2011 Toyota Camry LE in Silver" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="4T4BF3EK2BR138512" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/toyota/camry/2011/vin/4T4BF3EK2BR138512/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2011<!-- --> <!-- -->Toyota<!-- --> <!-- -->Camry<!-- --> <!-- -->LE</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(196, 203, 211)" title="Exterior Color: Classic Silver Metallic" aria-label="Exterior Color: Classic Silver Metallic"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(124, 119, 116)" title="Interior Color: Ash cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Ash cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">39,067 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="0 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span></span> (<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</span></div><div class="d-inline-block bg-gray-extra-light small px-0_25 text-gray-darker"><span class="icon-transit mr-0_25"></span> <!-- -->Delivery Available<sup>*</sup></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->2000385146</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$13,200</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without ever stepping foot inside a dealership! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Camry is more than meets the eye. This Camry is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. Enjoy the comfortable (and easy to clean) leather seats. You can cover miles with ease with available cruise control. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Jason and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer&#x27;s remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn&#x27;t live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we&#x27;ll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase. Have a question about the car you&#x27;re looking at, or about the purchase process in general? Visit us at Carvana.com to learn more!

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without having to wrestle with a salesperson! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Camry is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Camry has a 7.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Camry is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can also avoid any issues with a lead foot by engaging the cruise control on this Camry. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Sidney and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer&#x27;s remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn&#x27;t live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we&#x27;ll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase.

I asked to see it but the salesman told me it was clean but only after the sale I was able to see it in the paperwork. It wasn&#x27;t clean. The finance person financed it through a company other than the one we asked for and at twice the interest rate and lied about it. When I complained about this stuff they had us talk to their best lying sales people and tried to get even more money. I would not shop there again.

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without ever stepping foot inside a dealership! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Camry is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Camry has a 7.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Camry is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can cover miles with ease with available cruise control. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Sidney and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer&#x27;s remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn&#x27;t live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we&#x27;ll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase. Have a question about the car you&#x27;re looking at, or about the purchase process in general?

Bought it with 5 miles on it.  On the way home the shifting lag became pronounced.  Acceleration was jerky and the lag made it dangerous.  Went back to Toyota Irvine Service dept. Which was a nightmare in &amp; of itself. They were no help, rude and 4 hours later they told me it was normal. Offered us to test drive another and see that</span><span class="sr-only"> they are all that way. After zero help from Toyota I tried anything and everything to fix the issues. It turns out the lag and jerky shifting is due to the traction control system.  If you turn off traction control using the button on the dashboard left of the steering  wheel. The car drives how you expect a Camry should. It shifts smoothly and has a more aggressive acceleration response.  I just want Toyota to come up with a permanent solution so I don&#x27;t have to disable traction control each time I start the car.</span></div><div class="col-12"><button type="button"

The Camry offers a ton of versatility for the price, but can also be optioned up to give buyers that luxury car feel if they so desire.","dealerInfo":{"address":{"apartment":"","city":"Staten Island","stateCode":"NY","stateName":"New York","street":"1591 Hylan Blvd","zip":"10305"},"displayInfo":{"fiveStarYears":[2017,2018],"parentDealershipName":"","salesOverallRating":5,"salesReviewCount":1},"franchiseId":"758097","partnerCode":"IMT_EDDIRECT","productFeatures":{"verified":true,"lpStatus":false,"lpInventory":false,"ppStatus":false,"ppInventory":false,"directDealer":true,"simpleDisplay":false,"gpUseDlCoverage":false,"hasGasCard":true,"upInventory":false,"usedVehicleProtectionPlan":true,"upStatus":true,"onlineLeaseEligible":false,"digitalRetail":{"lease":{}}},"rooftopId":12275,"rooftopLogicalName":"IslandToyota_12275","phoneNumbers":{"basic":{"areaCode":"718","prefix":"987","postfix":"7100"},"trackable":{"areaCode":"866","prefix":"826","postfix":"1734"},"ppTrackable":{"areaCode":"866","prefix":"826","postfix":"1734"}},"name":"Island Toyota","sortOrders":{}},"prices":{"gasCard":{"product":"AutoNation","amount":100},"guaranteedPriceDelta":0,"baseMsrp":23840,"totalMsrp":25048,"displayPrice":14999,"displayPriceDelta":-1000,"displayPriceDeltaTimestamp":1569683034315,"leasePromise":{},"loan":{"payment":279.63}},"vehicleInfo":{"mileage":31381,"vehicleColors":{"exterior":{"id":"200747477","name":"Midnight Black Metallic","nameRGB":"Midnight Black Metallic|23,23,23","genericName":"Black","r":23,"g":23,"b":23},"interior":{"id":"200747485","name":"Black leatherette/cloth","nameRGB":"Black leatherette/cloth|60,60,60","genericName":"Black","r":60,"g":60,"b":60},"interiorTrim":{},"roof":{}},"partsInfo":{"driveTrain":"front wheel drive","cylinders":4,"engineType":"gas","fuelType":"regular unleaded","transmission":"AUTOMATIC","cgf":[{"name":"USB Inputs","formattedName":"17: USB Inputs"},{"name":"Tire Pressure Warning","formattedName":"13: Tire Pressure Warning"},{"name":"Rear Bench Seats","formattedName":"32: Rear Bench Seats"},{"name":"Audio and cruise controls on steering wheel","formattedName":"59: Audio and cruise controls on steering wheel"},{"name":"Back-up camera","formattedName":"2: Back-up camera"},{"name":"Stability Control","formattedName":"33: Stability Control"},{"name":"Aux Audio Inputs","formattedName":"34: Aux Audio Inputs"},{"name":"Power Driver Seat","formattedName":"12: Power Driver Seat"},{"name":"Bluetooth","formattedName":"3: Bluetooth"},{"name":"Fold Flat Rear Seats","formattedName":"48: Fold Flat Rear Seats"},{"name":"Trip Computer","formattedName":"31: Trip Computer"}]},"photo":{"defaultPhoto":{"largePhotoCount":30,"smallPhotoCount":30}},"styleInfo":{"bodyType":"Sedan","make":"Toyota","makeModel":"Toyota|Camry","model":"Camry","modelId":"200746613","trim":"SE","styleId":"200746619","style":"SE 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl 6A)","year":2016,"subModels":[{"name":"Camry Sedan","niceId":"sedan","identifier":"Sedan"}],"vehicleCategories":["Sedan"],"oemModelCode":"2546","fuel":{"epaCombinedMPG":28,"epaCityMPG":25,"epaHighwayMPG":35}}},"computedInfo":{"discountPrice":2459,"savingsPercent":14.085233130942834},"listedSince":1562050800000,"deliveryOptions":{},"historyInfo":{"personalUseOnly":false,"historyProvider":"EXPERIAN","salvageHistory":false,"frameDamage":false,"lemonHistory":false,"theftHistory":false,"ownerText":"1","accidentText":"0","usageType":"Corporate Fleet","cleanTitle":true,"freeHistoryReport":false,"noAccidents":true},"computedDisplayInfo":{"ctas":["details"],"priceDiscount":2459,"phoneNumber":"866-826-1734","showPhoneNumber":true,"perksAvailable":true,"estimatedDaysToSell":-50},"dealerSalesReviewText":"Recently my wife and I were window shopping on Sunday at Island auto group Toyota.\nWe really were not looking to buy right away ,we were just looking for a future purchase!

The other dealerships I visited did not take me seriously as a purchaser because I still had 8 payments left on the lease on my car, despite me telling them I could purchase at any time. I spoke with one of the managers when I first got to the dealership because I wanted a salesperson that wouldn't tick me off as I have several years of experience in car sales and as finance manager and I know how a customer should be treated. Mike Gerreine was my salesman and he was wonderful!  He took me seriously as a female looking to purchase a pickup truck. While I decided the Ranger wasn't for me Mike showed me a 3.5 EcoBoost F-150 that I loved and ended up buying. It just so happens the exact vehicle I bought was at one of the other dealerships I had visited before coming to Northgate Ford and Mike was happy to get it for me. The dealership gave me a strong offer on my Honda Civic that I traded in ultimately.  The whole process was smooth with no pressure to buy a new vehicle or trade in my car which I appreciated.  I highly recommend my salesman Mike Gerrein and Northgate Ford if you are looking for a new vehicle!"},{"thirdPartyInfo":{"priceValidation":{}},"vid":"AB1B2B4FC41845606AFFB8064270D690","vin":"4T4BF3EK2BR138512","stockNumber":"2000385146","type":"USED","sellersComments":"Got your eye on a 2011 Toyota Camry that seats 5 and gets 32 MPG? With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without ever stepping foot inside a dealership! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Camry is more than meets the eye. This Camry is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. Enjoy the comfortable (and easy to clean) leather seats. You can cover miles with ease with available cruise control. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Jason and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer's remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn't live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we'll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase.

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without ever stepping foot inside a dealership! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Camry is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Camry has a 7.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Camry is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can cover miles with ease with available cruise control. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Sidney and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer's remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn't live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we'll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase.

solved!!!","text":"Test drive was fine, but it was basically all freeway. Bought it with 5 miles on it.  On the way home the shifting lag became pronounced.  Acceleration was jerky and the lag made it dangerous.  Went back to Toyota Irvine Service dept. Which was a nightmare in & of itself. They were no help, rude and 4 hours later they told me it was normal. Offered us to test drive another and see that they are all that way. After zero help from Toyota I tried anything and everything to fix the issues. It turns out the lag and jerky shifting is due to the traction control system.  If you turn off traction control using the button on the dashboard left of the steering  wheel. The car drives how you expect a Camry should. It shifts smoothly and has a more aggressive acceleration response.  I just want Toyota to come up with a permanent solution so I don't have to disable traction control each time I start the car.
