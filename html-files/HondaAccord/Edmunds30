My experience with Scott Clark Honda been awful.  Their service is horrible and it doesn’t take them long to start making sarcastic comments. I don’t want to put any names here but if their management wants, then I can share the names of the employees. In a nut shell, go else where Its not worth wasting your time with some unprofessional people at Scott Clark. </p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2018<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX-L w/Navi<!-- --> with Remote Start, Stability Control, Mobile Internet, Auto Climate Control, Adaptive Cruise Control<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>33<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->30<!-- --> City/<!-- -->38<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->07-24-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCV1F61JA010226" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCV1F61JA010226" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="851381" data-dealer-rooftop-id="894496" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2016 Honda Accord LX in Black" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2016/vin/1HGCR2F35GA236018/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/b1-1hgcr2f35ga236018/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2016 Honda Accord LX in Black" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCR2F35GA236018" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2016/vin/1HGCR2F35GA236018/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2016<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->LX</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(29, 29, 29)" title="Exterior Color: Crystal Black Pearl" aria-label="Exterior Color: Crystal Black Pearl"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(156, 141, 128)" title="Interior Color: Ivory cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Ivory cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">12,029 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="0 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span></span> (<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->236018</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$13,500</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

I went there to look at a specific truck they had online and Corey was very helpful answering any questions, and made the process easy when I decided to buy. There was no pressure to make a decision and no attempts to push me into a higher priced truck. I have experienced this at other dealerships and it was a nice change. Overall the process went very smoothly and from the time I stepped onto the lot to the time I drove off with my new vehicle was under an hour and a half. </p><p class="text-gray-dark small

I can’t say enough regarding the exceptional service I’ve received each time I’ve stepped foot in this dealership. They don’t push an agenda, as many other dealerships I’ve visited have, but work with you to find the best possible solution to your specific need. I recommend Dominique, and the Criswell Honda team, to all my family and friends because I believe these are truly people that have the customers best interest at heart and who can be trusted. Yes, they are in the business of selling cars but they do it the right way and in a professional, ethical manner through which they are able to provide a great product that fits the customers need in the best way possible. If you have an automotive need I highly recommend Criswell Honda.

They had one that looked appealing and I contacted them to confirm it was available. I met with Daniel Liston, who did a great job of advertising the vehicle on the internet, and he introduced me to Grady Owen. Grady was very professional and pleasant to deal with. I feel the price paid was fair to both parties. My overall experience at this dealership was a very pleasant one. Should the time every come when I needed to purchase another car I would return to Bennett Toyota of Allentown.</p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary

I couldn’t be happier about my new lease through Keeler and how easy it all was. Adam is upfront but not pushy. He’s friendly, genuine and overall just excellent at what he does. His customer service far exceeded my expectations. He’s always so quick to respond, even on his days off! I am very pleased with my entire experience and absolutely love my new car. Highly recommend! </p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2018<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX-L<!-- --> with Remote Start, Stability Control, Mobile Internet, Auto Climate Control, Adaptive Cruise Control<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>33<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->30<!-- --> City/<!-- -->38<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->Yes<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->08-14-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCV1F54JA055958" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCV1F54JA055958" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="1802190" data-dealer-rooftop-id="1802186" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><span class="display-inline-block bg-primary-darker text-white rounded p-0_25 xsmall pill">Certified Pre-Owned</span><a aria-label="2019 Honda Accord EX in White" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2019/vin/1HGCV1F48KA046804/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/25-1hgcv1f48ka046804/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2019 Honda Accord EX in White" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCV1F48KA046804" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2019/vin/1HGCV1F48KA046804/?national=true">Certified<!-- --> <!-- -->2019<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(231, 233, 232)" title="Exterior Color: Platinum White Pearl" aria-label="Exterior Color: Platinum White Pearl"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(222, 214, 195)" title="Interior Color: Ivory cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Ivory cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">5,272 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="5 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span></span> (<!-- -->3<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->L046804</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$24,497</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

a 2014 Ford Focus and it was having transmission issues (well known problem). I decided to shop around and after I drove the Accord Touring I knew I had found my new car. I looked at the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 as well as comparable sedans like the Camry and Mazda 6. At the end of the day, this car gives you great value and it looks so well made and handles like a dream. I would rather the top trim of this Accord than the bottom of a luxury brand. The features are phenomenal and it truly feels luxurious
