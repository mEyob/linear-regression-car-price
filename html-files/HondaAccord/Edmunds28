I have drawn two of my own:
1-One can completely trust this dealership to be excellent at:  erroneously populating purchase agreements on multiple occasions, increasing agreed upon sales price, having computer problems, and thinking they are selling you a car for which you had never shown any interest.  Or, perhaps, instead of all of the above, they are just excellent at lying.  There is no choice, it must be one or the other.
2-They are disrespectful [non-permissible content removed]

Here are the facts:
5/13/2018 15:39 I called the dealership 800 number and spoke with Nick, and asked him to email me information on the Silver 2014 Grand Caravan R/T listed for sale.

5/13 16:33 I received an email from Nick with information requested.

5/13 19:55 I replied to email and indicated I would be unable to discuss price during normal working hours due to my schedule but that my wife would be in contact.

5/14 13:22 I received text from Sergio Casimir: Hello john this is Sergio from auto show you were inquiring about the 2014 dodge caravan r/t.  Give me a call when you get a chance.  Thank you.

5/14 13:26 I sent a text to Sergio: Thanks, Sergio.  I cant until late tonight but Ill have my wife call you.

5/14 13:54 I received a text from Sergio Ok sounds good.  Thank you

5/15 16:53 My wife called and spoke with Sergio, requested he email his best out the door cost on the Silver 2014 Grand Caravan R/T

5/15 17:30 Wife received email purchase agreement from Sergio with itemized total cost of the vehicle

5/16 13:46 Wife called Sergio and pointed out the tax calculation error (purchase agreement clearly stated 3% but value at 5% was on the line item) as well as the fact that the list price was on the purchase agreement.  She requested that he give her his best price (again).  He said he would speak with his manager about a price reduction and get back to her as well as mentioning a few other cars that we may be interested in, including a Kia Optima.  She indicated that all she wanted was his best price on the Silver 2014 Grand Caravan R/T.

5/16 20:17 Sergio called my wife and said he could go to $14,600.  She said she would talk to me and get back to him.

5/16 20:47 Wife called Sergio and told him we agreed on the $14,600 and to please send an updated version of the purchase agreement and that once we received it we would make our deposit.  NOTE:  This is the point at which a verbal contract had been established, among honorable partys

5/16 21:05 I purchased a plane ticket to Fort Lauderdale for $104 leaving at 7:30 on 5/19 (with a 24h prior to flight refundable cancellation policy).

5/17 10:22 Sergio called my wife and confirmed our correct address, whos name would appear on the title, and their date of birth for the paperwork.  He explained how to make a deposit on the website and once he corrected the purchase agreement, would overnight all of the paperwork to us so that we could have everything filled out to bring to the dealership on Saturday, May 19th.  It was at this point that it was discussed that I would be flying down to pick up the car and driving it back to North Carolina.  Sergio then told my wife he would even pick me up at the airport in the Silver 2014 Grand Caravan R/T.

5/17 13:19 Wife received email with updated purchase agreement.  Title information was added and the tax information was corrected (from value at 5% to 3%) but the price was still listed at the list price.

5/17 13:20 Wife texted Sergio to let him know the price on the purchase agreement was erroneous; it should be $14,600 as agreed.  He said he would fix it.

5/17 13:49 Sergio texted my wife and said he has it approved to $14,690, not $14,600.

5/17 13:54 Wife texted Sergio and told him that is the number that was discussed and to ask his manager to honor the agreed upon price.

5/17 13:57 Sergio called my wife and said sorry it would be $14,690 but he would make sure the gas tank would be full for my drive back to North Carolina.  My wife begrudgingly agreed and, once again, told him that we would make a deposit once we received a corrected purchase agreement via email.  He, once again, told her that he would overnight the paperwork to us to fill out and sign.  And for me to bring a cashiers check for the remainder of the total cost less the $1,000 online deposit we would be making once correct purchase agreement was received.

5/17 17:44 Sergio called my wife and said there are problems with the computer but if he couldnt send the purchase agreement overnight, no big deal, we could just title the vehicle and sign the paperwork in person once I arrived in the morning, on Saturday May 19th.

5/17 21:03 Wife had missed call from Sergio, no message left

5/18 9:34 Sergio called wife and told her updated purchase agreement was being emailed (which my wife never received).  He then said that he saw an error on the purchase agreement, It still says Caravan instead of Kia.  My wife told him we have been talking about the Silver 2014 Grand Caravan R/T since day 1, we never indicated any interest in a Kia sedan at any point, ever.  He said he would call back in a few minutes once he got to his office.

5/18 9:40 Sergio called my wife and told her that the caravan had been sold last night.
5/19 17:13 I sent email to Amin Baker, General Manger, requesting reimbursement of $104 for airfare:
Mr. Baker,
Over the past week, we had a poor experience attempting to purchase a vehicle from your dealership resulting in my personal loss finances for which your employee is liable.  I understand that mistakes and miscommunications can be made in the business of selling cars.  However, that does not negate the fact that once a verbal agreement is made, it is reasonable that your company must assume liability for any costs incurred by your prospective customer from that point forward with regard to the agreement should you not hold up your end of the bargain.  I am not upset about not getting the vehicle that we would have liked to purchase from your company.  I am simply asking that you do what you know to be right and ethical by your prospective customer.
 
I am requesting that you reimburse me for the amount of $104, the cost of my unused plane ticket.  The time at which we were notified that the deal had been terminated was less than the necessary 24 hour period required for refunding of the fare.  My loss of these funds was completely out of my hands and entirely in your employee&#x27;s hands.

5/19 17:20 Amin emailed me asking for me to call him to discuss further

5/19 17:24 I called and left a VM on Mr. Bakers line

5/29 18:32 I called again, got Mark, he took my name and number for Amin to call me back

5/29 20:26 Sergio&#x27;s manager called me and I told the story.  Long story short, he said that without a deposit it is not held.  I explained to him that all we were tying to do was to put down a deposit. Said he would talk to Sergio and call me tomorrow.  It is now 6/12/18 and, even though I emailed Amin on 6/6 AGAIN, still waiting to hear from them.

Cross your fingers, should you choose to do business with these people!

They were very busy and it took about 5 hours to finish. In their defense they are busy on Saturdays and were doing the best they could. So I just suggest avoiding Saturday if you can. Brett was my salesman and he was nice, patient and personable. Most importantly to me he was not at all pushy. He let me do my thing without any pressure. And although the car pretty much sold me, it was icing on the cake that I didn&#x27;t have to deal with a pushy salesman that was trying to up sell me at every turn. He did his best to get me the best deal possible and was very informative. He sat and talked with my family and I while numbers were being crunched and it didn&#x27;t feel awkward at all. He really did take care of us up until the end. Casey was the guy who finished up with us in finance. He was extremely personable and even though he had been there long past his scheduled time off he still took his time explaining things. It was my first time financing and he explained everything so I could understand. Part of the reason the process took so long was because he was researching how to get me the extended warranty I wanted. It couldn&#x27;t be done with the vehicle I bought but he did his best to look at every avenue that was possible. The small talk he made during the process made me feel comfortable as well. This was the biggest move I have made as far as buying a car goes and it felt so easy thanks to AutoNation Honda. They detail the car and fill up the tank for you as well. Total bonus! I will definitely be back for my future needs and send anyone else I know looking for a car in their direction.

My car died and I really wasn’t prepared to buy a new car, so this was not a happy time for me at all.  I really didn’t want to give up my old car.  It had been really good to me.  But the team at Off Lease Only’s Broward location went out of their way, above and beyond to make the transition as pleasant as it could possibly be.  Special thanks to Mindy Gallagher.  I have a new friend now. She was absolutely awesome! She cared about my concerns.  I felt like I had my own personal assistant helping me through the process.  The salesperson, Cliff, was a pleasure to work with.  Great smile!   
I don’t believe any dealership will ever give you what your car is worth to you.  We have memories attached to our cars, at least I did. It was really hard to part with it.  The appraiser, David, was great.  He was personable and understanding, and gave a fair price for my car, especially considering its condition.  The underwriter, Favio, worked hard on my behalf.  The Finance manager, Jonathan, was great.  He wasn’t pushy and was understanding of my situation.  I went with the GAP insurance (can’t imagine why anyone in their right mind would not get GAP).  He explained everything thoroughly so I knew what every signature represented.  The General Manager, Teresa, was sincere in following up throughout the process and checking in with me from time to time, right through to the end.  Even the security guard, Alfa, was a bright ray of sunshine in the midst of the day.  I can’t say enough about the professionalism, the efficiency, the friendliness, and genuine concern I received from the Off Lease Only team.  I felt like part of the family.  I would not hesitate to recommend friends and family to Off Lease Only.  They’re truly a FIRST CLASS operation.  THANK YOU!!

But Jim Simpson was by far the nicest, and most helpful out of all the salespeople we had encountered.  Even though Wilde was closed on Sunday Jim was communicating with us via text answering our questions.  We finally selected an Avalon.  Completed all the paperwork.  But due to our schedule we were unable to wait for the service department to detail the car.  Even though Jim was scheduled to be off that night he agreed to wait until we returned.  What a nice gesture. It was a pleasant buying experience with Wilde.      </p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features

The entire experience was professional, casual and without pressure.

Bruce knows the product line in great detail; capabilities of trim levels &amp; options, vehicle specifications &amp; technical details. He offered a test drive which gave me a sense of the vehicle&#x27;s real world driving characteristics at various speeds &amp; on various road surfaces.

As he knows how to use the database, he found a vehicle, enroute to the dealership, which was closest to the trim level &amp; options I wanted. (I was in a slight bind; needed my new vehicle soon, so I couldn&#x27;t quite get exactly what I desired in the time-frame I had.) 

Upon delivery, the Crosstrek was in perfect condition. Bruce explained some function, asked &amp; answered any questions.

Though he had family obligations, he took the time to complete vehicle delivery in a courteous &amp; professional fashion.


With previous experiences from dealers that were not Morrie&#x27;s, I initially braced for the &quot;usual&quot; car dealer experience. Buying from Morrie&#x27;s Brooklyn Park Subaru gave me an unusual experience; I had an exceptionally good experience.

I will easily recommend Bruce &amp; Morrie&#x27;s Subaru.

I originally came in on a busy Sunday to look at cars after mine was totaled. I was on a fairly strict budget since it would need to be financed and I have no money to put down. Came in with my husband and both kids and he was very patient with us. Looked at the 2015 Chevy Malibu and loved it but wasn&#x27;t ready to pull the trigger so I made plans to come back Tuesday and look at more cars. 

Come Tuesday, Ryan was there again and ready to help. This time it was just me and my 11 month old. Once again, Ryan was extremely patient while I tried to focus and wrangle a VERY mobile baby. We looked at a Mazda and a Focus. I liked the Mazda but couldn&#x27;t get financed for it. So we looked at the Malibu again and was able to get the financing into my price point. Ryan helped play with my son while I filled out all the paperwork and the rest of the team was great and keeping him entertained as well. I&#x27;m so excited to come back on Saturday and pick up my new car.

I would highly recommend Ryan and Kings Honda as a great place to buy a used cars.

Patrick Cadet was really great in explaining all the features of the car and he encouraged us to tell him exactly what features were important to our family etc, so he could point us in the right direction. I love the fact that unlike previous car buying experiences, we didnt feel pressured, rushed or like a commission check. Patrick was patient and answered every question with true honesty. We love our Honda Accord and the fact that we simply stopped by for a test drive and left with my dream car that same day.....says alot.

We knew what kind of car we wanted and needed one quickly!  We went in with the idea to look at a 2013 Sentra that was on the website but unfortunately it was sold.  The sales associated Corey, who was very friendly, tried to find us other options including a Versa and other Sentras that may be available.  Unfortunately we also had a budget we wanted to stick to.  Corey understood our budget and, while there was nothing that fot into our budget he brought up options and explained the benefits of spending a little more and that him and his manager Jovan would work to get us something that may be closer to what we were looking for. After speaking to Jovan, the found that they just took in another car that was listed at $14,900 and online for $13,500. This was out of our budget but they informed us that if we liked it they could see what they could do.  Corey went to get the car and Jovan sat with us and engaged in friendly conversation, something much needed during a stressful time!  Jovan was great!  Corey returned with the car and it was just what we were looking for so we took it for a teat drive and fell in love. Jovan and Corey workes hard to get the car into our price range and even agreed to buff out a scratch.  

We then went to work with the finance associate Shand.  Shand was very friendly and not pushy at all. He explained all options that we had and when we declined he completely understood. Shand engaged us on a personal level and put us at ease. He was fast and efficient at the process and got us on our way very quick.

Overall, the folks at Kelly Nissan Lynnfield were all around 5-stars. They understood our needs, worked hard to meet our needs, did not push is in an overly salesy way, and we walked out with a beautiful car for a price that was very reasonable. This is the 3rd car a member of our extended family has bought from Kelly Nissan Lynnfield and it has been a pleasurable experience every time.</p><p class="text-gray-dark small

Upon arrival at the dealership, he had already brought the car I was interested in up to the front of the building.  He went over all of the car&#x27;s bells and whistles and explained how several of them worked.  Allowed for a complete test drive.  Helpful in filling out the paperwork and application for financial assistance.  I would most certainly recommend Philip and this dealership to any of my friends if they are looking to buy a vehicle.  ALSO, would like to add that Matt in finance bent over backwards (not literally because his back was very sore that day LOL), to find just the right financing and at very nice terms.  Thank you to both of them for a very enjoyable experience.

I have drawn two of my own:\n1-One can completely trust this dealership to be excellent at:  erroneously populating purchase agreements on multiple occasions, increasing agreed upon sales price, having computer problems, and thinking they are selling you a car for which you had never shown any interest.  Or, perhaps, instead of all of the above, they are just excellent at lying.  There is no choice, it must be one or the other.\n2-They are disrespectful [non-permissible content removed]\n\nHere are the facts:\n5/13/2018 15:39 I called the dealership 800 number and spoke with Nick, and asked him to email me information on the Silver 2014 Grand Caravan R/T listed for sale.\n\n5/13 16:33 I received an email from Nick with information requested.\n\n5/13 19:55 I replied to email and indicated I would be unable to discuss price during normal working hours due to my schedule but that my wife would be in contact.\n\n5/14 13:22 I received text from Sergio Casimir: Hello john this is Sergio from auto show you were inquiring about the 2014 dodge caravan r/t.  Give me a call when you get a chance.  Thank you.\n\n5/14 13:26 I sent a text to Sergio: Thanks, Sergio.  I cant until late tonight but Ill have my wife call you.\n\n5/14 13:54 I received a text from Sergio Ok sounds good.  Thank you\n\n5/15 16:53 My wife called and spoke with Sergio, requested he email his best out the door cost on the Silver 2014 Grand Caravan R/T\n\n5/15 17:30 Wife received email purchase agreement from Sergio with itemized total cost of the vehicle\n\n5/16 13:46 Wife called Sergio and pointed out the tax calculation error (purchase agreement clearly stated 3% but value at 5% was on the line item) as well as the fact that the list price was on the purchase agreement.  She requested that he give her his best price (again).  He said he would speak with his manager about a price reduction and get back to her as well as mentioning a few other cars that we may be interested in, including a Kia Optima.  She indicated that all she wanted was his best price on the Silver 2014 Grand Caravan R/T.\n\n5/16 20:17 Sergio called my wife and said he could go to $14,600.  She said she would talk to me and get back to him.\n\n5/16 20:47 Wife called Sergio and told him we agreed on the $14,600 and to please send an updated version of the purchase agreement and that once we received it we would make our deposit.  NOTE:  This is the point at which a verbal contract had been established, among honorable partys\n\n5/16 21:05 I purchased a plane ticket to Fort Lauderdale for $104 leaving at 7:30 on 5/19 (with a 24h prior to flight refundable cancellation policy).\n\n5/17 10:22 Sergio called my wife and confirmed our correct address, whos name would appear on the title, and their date of birth for the paperwork.  He explained how to make a deposit on the website and once he corrected the purchase agreement, would overnight all of the paperwork to us so that we could have everything filled out to bring to the dealership on Saturday, May 19th.  It was at this point that it was discussed that I would be flying down to pick up the car and driving it back to North Carolina.  Sergio then told my wife he would even pick me up at the airport in the Silver 2014 Grand Caravan R/T.\n\n5/17 13:19 Wife received email with updated purchase agreement.  Title information was added and the tax information was corrected (from value at 5% to 3%) but the price was still listed at the list price.\n\n5/17 13:20 Wife texted Sergio to let him know the price on the purchase agreement was erroneous; it should be $14,600 as agreed.  He said he would fix it.\n\n5/17 13:49 Sergio texted my wife and said he has it approved to $14,690, not $14,600.\n\n5/17 13:54 Wife texted Sergio and told him that is the number that was discussed and to ask his manager to honor the agreed upon price.\n\n5/17 13:57 Sergio called my wife and said sorry it would be $14,690 but he would make sure the gas tank would be full for my drive back to North Carolina.  My wife begrudgingly agreed and, once again, told him that we would make a deposit once we received a corrected purchase agreement via email.  He, once again, told her that he would overnight the paperwork to us to fill out and sign.  And for me to bring a cashiers check for the remainder of the total cost less the $1,000 online deposit we would be making once correct purchase agreement was received.\n\n5/17 17:44 Sergio called my wife and said there are problems with the computer but if he couldnt send the purchase agreement overnight, no big deal, we could just title the vehicle and sign the paperwork in person once I arrived in the morning, on Saturday May 19th.\n\n5/17 21:03 Wife had missed call from Sergio, no message left\n\n5/18 9:34 Sergio called wife and told her updated purchase agreement was being emailed (which my wife never received).  He then said that he saw an error on the purchase agreement, It still says Caravan instead of Kia.  My wife told him we have been talking about the Silver 2014 Grand Caravan R/T since day 1, we never indicated any interest in a Kia sedan at any point, ever.  He said he would call back in a few minutes once he got to his office.\n\n5/18 9:40 Sergio called my wife and told her that the caravan had been sold last night.\n5/19 17:13 I sent email to Amin Baker, General Manger, requesting reimbursement of $104 for airfare:\nMr. Baker,\nOver the past week, we had a poor experience attempting to purchase a vehicle from your dealership resulting in my personal loss finances for which your employee is liable.  I understand that mistakes and miscommunications can be made in the business of selling cars.  However, that does not negate the fact that once a verbal agreement is made, it is reasonable that your company must assume liability for any costs incurred by your prospective customer from that point forward with regard to the agreement should you not hold up your end of the bargain.  I am not upset about not getting the vehicle that we would have liked to purchase from your company.  I am simply asking that you do what you know to be right and ethical by your prospective customer.\n \nI am requesting that you reimburse me for the amount of $104, the cost of my unused plane ticket.  The time at which we were notified that the deal had been terminated was less than the necessary 24 hour period required for refunding of the fare.  My loss of these funds was completely out of my hands and entirely in your employee's hands.\n\n5/19 17:20 Amin emailed me asking for me to call him to discuss further\n\n5/19 17:24 I called and left a VM on Mr. Bakers line\n\n5/29 18:32 I called again, got Mark, he took my name and number for Amin to call me back\n\n5/29 20:26 Sergio's manager called me and I told the story.  Long story short, he said that without a deposit it is not held.  I explained to him that all we were tying to do was to put down a deposit. Said he would talk to Sergio and call me tomorrow.  It is now 6/12/18 and, even though I emailed Amin on 6/6 AGAIN, still waiting to hear from them.\n\nCross your fingers, should you choose to do business with these people!\n"},{"thirdPartyInfo":{"priceValidation":{"cop":20884,"listPriceEstimate":21781,"evm":20195,"lowerbound":19360,"upperbound":20905,"dealType":"Good"}},"vid":"F4DAA7A28A0B56D7171D236EAC388925","vin":"1HGCV1F1XJA132829","stockNumber":"JA132829","type":"USED","sellersComments":"Lane Keeping Assist,Keyless Start,Bluetooth Connection,IVORY; CLOTH SEAT TRIM,RADIANT RED METALLIC\n\nThis vehicle includes a Money-Back Guarantee* and passed our precise inspection process.

They were very busy and it took about 5 hours to finish. In their defense they are busy on Saturdays and were doing the best they could. So I just suggest avoiding Saturday if you can. Brett was my salesman and he was nice, patient and personable. Most importantly to me he was not at all pushy. He let me do my thing without any pressure. And although the car pretty much sold me, it was icing on the cake that I didn't have to deal with a pushy salesman that was trying to up sell me at every turn. He did his best to get me the best deal possible and was very informative. He sat and talked with my family and I while numbers were being crunched and it didn't feel awkward at all. He really did take care of us up until the end. Casey was the guy who finished up with us in finance. He was extremely personable and even though he had been there long past his scheduled time off he still took his time explaining things. It was my first time financing and he explained everything so I could understand. Part of the reason the process took so long was because he was researching how to get me the extended warranty I wanted. It couldn't be done with the vehicle I bought but he did his best to look at every avenue that was possible. The small talk he made during the process made me feel comfortable as well. This was the biggest move I have made as far as buying a car goes and it felt so easy thanks to AutoNation Honda. They detail the car and fill up the tank for you as well. Total bonus! I will definitely be back for my future needs and send anyone else I know looking for a car in their direction.

My car died and I really wasn’t prepared to buy a new car, so this was not a happy time for me at all.  I really didn’t want to give up my old car.  It had been really good to me.  But the team at Off Lease Only’s Broward location went out of their way, above and beyond to make the transition as pleasant as it could possibly be.  Special thanks to Mindy Gallagher.  I have a new friend now. She was absolutely awesome! She cared about my concerns.  I felt like I had my own personal assistant helping me through the process.  The salesperson, Cliff, was a pleasure to work with.  Great smile!   \nI don’t believe any dealership will ever give you what your car is worth to you.  We have memories attached to our cars, at least I did. It was really hard to part with it.  The appraiser, David, was great.  He was personable and understanding, and gave a fair price for my car, especially considering its condition.  The underwriter, Favio, worked hard on my behalf.  The Finance manager, Jonathan, was great.  He wasn’t pushy and was understanding of my situation.  I went with the GAP insurance (can’t imagine why anyone in their right mind would not get GAP).  He explained everything thoroughly so I knew what every signature represented.  The General Manager, Teresa, was sincere in following up throughout the process and checking in with me from time to time, right through to the end.  Even the security guard, Alfa, was a bright ray of sunshine in the midst of the day.  I can’t say enough about the professionalism, the efficiency, the friendliness, and genuine concern I received from the Off Lease Only team.  I felt like part of the family.  I would not hesitate to recommend friends and family to Off Lease Only.  They’re truly a FIRST CLASS operation.

I originally came in on a busy Sunday to look at cars after mine was totaled. I was on a fairly strict budget since it would need to be financed and I have no money to put down. Came in with my husband and both kids and he was very patient with us. Looked at the 2015 Chevy Malibu and loved it but wasn't ready to pull the trigger so I made plans to come back Tuesday and look at more cars. \n\nCome Tuesday, Ryan was there again and ready to help. This time it was just me and my 11 month old. Once again, Ryan was extremely patient while I tried to focus and wrangle a VERY mobile baby. We looked at a Mazda and a Focus. I liked the Mazda but couldn't get financed for it. So we looked at the Malibu again and was able to get the financing into my price point. Ryan helped play with my son while I filled out all the paperwork and the rest of the team was great and keeping him entertained as well. I'm so excited to come back on Saturday and pick up my new car.\n\nI would highly recommend Ryan and Kings Honda as a great place to buy a used cars.

We knew what kind of car we wanted and needed one quickly!  We went in with the idea to look at a 2013 Sentra that was on the website but unfortunately it was sold.  The sales associated Corey, who was very friendly, tried to find us other options including a Versa and other Sentras that may be available.  Unfortunately we also had a budget we wanted to stick to.  Corey understood our budget and, while there was nothing that fot into our budget he brought up options and explained the benefits of spending a little more and that him and his manager Jovan would work to get us something that may be closer to what we were looking for. After speaking to Jovan, the found that they just took in another car that was listed at $14,900 and online for $13,500. This was out of our budget but they informed us that if we liked it they could see what they could do.  Corey went to get the car and Jovan sat with us and engaged in friendly conversation, something much needed during a stressful time!  Jovan was great!  Corey returned with the car and it was just what we were looking for so we took it for a teat drive and fell in love. Jovan and Corey workes hard to get the car into our price range and even agreed to buff out a scratch.  \r\n\r\nWe then went to work with the finance associate Shand.  Shand was very friendly and not pushy at all. He explained all options that we had and when we declined he completely understood. Shand engaged us on a personal level and put us at ease. He was fast and efficient at the process and got us on our way very quick.\r\n\r\nOverall, the folks at Kelly Nissan Lynnfield were all around 5-stars. They understood our needs, worked hard to meet our needs, did not push is in an overly salesy way, and we walked out with a beautiful car for a price that was very reasonable. This is the 3rd car a member of our extended family has bought from Kelly Nissan Lynnfield and it has been a pleasurable experience every time."},{"thirdPartyInfo":{"priceValidation":{"listPriceEstimate":28389,"dealType":"Good"}},"vid":"ED4E15C32E9E9843A694DB515BBCE115","vin":"1HGCV1F59KA051910","stockNumber":"192159A","type":"CPO","sellersComments":"Honda Certified, Excellent Condition, CARFAX 1-Owner, LOW MILES - 3,583!

a 2014 Ford Focus and it was having transmission issues (well known problem). I decided to shop around and after I drove the Accord Touring I knew I had found my new car. I looked at the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 as well as comparable sedans like the Camry and Mazda 6. At the end of the day, this car gives you great value and it looks so well made and handles like a dream. I would rather the top trim of this Accord than the bottom of a luxury brand. The features are phenomenal and it truly feels luxurious inside.","userName":"Elliot","createDate":"04-22-2019","modelYear":"2019","styleId":"401779176","thumbsUp":32,"userRating":5,"reviewExperienceSource":"OWNER"}],"totalReviewCount":1026,"averageConsumerRatings":4.2,"starRatingCount":{"oneStarRatingCount":40,"twoStarRatingCount":49,"threeStarRatingCount":136,"fourStarRatingCount":227,"fiveStarRatingCount":574}}},"attributes":{"vehicle":{"make":{"id":200001444,"name":"Honda","niceId":"honda"},"model":{"name":"Accord","modelLinkCode":"M030277","niceId":"accord"}},"inventoryType":"USED,CPO","sort":"boostControl5National:DESC","paymentType":"loan","sentient":{},"radius":6000}},"$partial":true,"adTargeting":{"$partial":true,"model":{"$partial":true,"accord":{"currentVehicle":null,"customTargeting":null}}}},"nativeAdsCreativeConfig":{"$partial":true,"adName":{"$partial":true,"srp-native-ad":{"$partial":true,"platform":{"$partial":true,"wired":{"$partial":true,"model":{"$partial":true,"accord":{"$partial":true,"year":{"$partial":true,"any":{"srp-native-ad":[{"id":"0d2cca43bd6e821f52f1e0640792c42c17bb512ca3079dcdd391bcf256738beb","name":"srp-native-ad","traffickingData":{"clickTracker":{"desktop":"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8821.2990.EDMUNDS.COMINC/B22474094.252311663;dc_trk_aid=439926874;dc_trk_cid=113991234;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=?https://automobiles.honda.com/tools/current-offers?zipcode=%%PATTERN:zip%%&vehiclemodelseries=accord-sedan","tablet":"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8821.2990.EDMUNDS.COMINC/B22474094.252311663;dc_trk_aid=439926874;dc_trk_cid=113991234;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=?https://automobiles.honda.com/tools/current-offers?zipcode=%%PATTERN:zip%%&vehiclemodelseries=accord-sedan","mobile":"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8821.2990.EDMUNDS.COMINC/B22474094.252311663;dc_trk_aid=439926874;dc_trk_cid=113991234;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=?https://automobiles.honda.com/tools/current-offers?zipcode=%%PATTERN:zip%%&vehiclemodelseries=accord-sedan"}},"creativeConfigData":{"creativeConfigId":"0d2cca43bd6e821f52f1e0640792c42c17bb512ca3079dcdd391bcf256738beb","lineItemId":"5128556320","creativeId":"native_srp_ret_v1","productSku":"WND017","disclaimerCopy":"","cta":"View
