We didn’t feel the typical cars sales guy pressure as we shopped for my new truck.  The color that we wanted wasn’t available at the time of purchase but he made sure we got exactly what we wanted. This is our first Audi (we owned a BMW X5, a Lincoln Navigator, and an Acura MDX) none of them can compare to my new Q7. We absolutely love the way it feels when we’re driving, and the technology it offers is very impressive. We’re new lifetime Audi owners who’s looking forward to forthcoming adventures in the 2019 Audi Q7 premium plus. </p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2009<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX-L<!-- --> with Tire Pressure Warning, Rear Bench Seats, Audio and cruise controls on steering wheel, Stability Control, Heated seats<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>24<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->21<!-- --> City/<!-- -->30<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->09-10-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCP26899A088024" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCP26899A088024" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="1876003" data-dealer-rooftop-id="1876002" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2015 Honda Accord LX in Gray" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2015/vin/1HGCR2F3XFA186649/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/7b-1hgcr2f3xfa186649/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2015 Honda Accord LX in Gray" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCR2F3XFA186649" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2015/vin/1HGCR2F3XFA186649/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2015<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->LX</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(51, 59, 72)" title="Exterior Color: Modern Steel Metallic" aria-label="Exterior Color: Modern Steel Metallic"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(25, 25, 25)" title="Interior Color: Black cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Black cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">65,650 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="4.33 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty2"></span></span> (<!-- -->6<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->G186649</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$11,999</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

With the assurance my Title to be mailed to my sister in laws in Ohio where I was moving to leaving Ca within the week. Do not mail to address on cdl for I was homeless while waiting for disabilty, that address was an Organization that you could use BUT they do not hold or will they forward your mail. I don&#x27;t know if there ever was an actual Title ever sent. All I ever received from DMV in Ca was Registration with a replacement missing tag and what looked like Registration with it stating I am the owner. Electronic Title transfer, NOT THE TITLE. I called so many times trying to tell them I need my Title. Bottom line my car in impound and I can&#x27;t get it WITHOUT TITLE OR RENEW CA REGISTRATION which is 300.00. I am on fixed income and car has been in impound since 4/1/2018. I have no means to pay for their screw up. They say doing what can, but unless they take responsibility for their screw up I just flushed 12268.74 down the drain. I have no car or the means to get anywhere. Also when asked Suzanne for copy of Sales Contract she sent a Registration card with the Ca address for the place that takes mail for homeless. They said call them, like they would hold that for 6 months, but I called and of course not there. She seems to have a problem with the difference between Registration, their Sales Contract, electronic Ca DMV Title transfer and what an actual AUTO TITLE  is. </p><table class="history-table xsmall table table-sm"><caption class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold pt-0">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary:</caption><tr><td>Accident Free Vehicle -

I saw a  one owner ore owned hybrid . The price was close to $24,000. I called the dealership and talked to Louis.  We made arrangements to come see the car.  I secured financing. I checked the internet again to show my wife her new car.  Guess what only a $ 3000 price increase. As A consolation was told if I finance through them I could get the Internet price I thought money was money silly me check prices before you go to this lot

They offered to only take $500 off the price off the price of the car, nothing more. This kind of place is that gives Used Car Dealers a bad Rep. They couldn&#x27;t even take the time to detail or wash the car before we test drove it after having plenty of advanced notice that we were coming to see that car. Needless to say we walked out with our money.

Agreed on the specific car down to the stock number and price.  Have all the dialog and specific car cost breakdown in emails.  Upon giving my deposit, Ollie tried to change the car. Very unethical. I should have known when he tried to charge me to put air in the tires.  Started with Raymond, then Ollie then handed off to Ruby. Terrible system, Very Shady &amp; Unethical.  Would not recommend. Typical car salesman crap and why people do not like dealing with car salesmen or buying a car.  I could still get the car but at the last minute, it was $700 more.  Very shady and crooked.  Do yourself a favor and buy elsewhere.  I actually did and purchased from Prescott Honda getting treated like a valued customer and saving money.  Purchased a 2018 at Prescott Honda for the same price Showcase wanted for a 2017 model.  While I do not know the people we dealt with personally, from a business perspective I found them to be shady and unethical and I cannot recommend.  Ruby was the only bright spot.

Do not mail to address on cdl for I was homeless while waiting for disabilty, that address was an Organization that you could use BUT they do not hold or will they forward your mail. I don't know if there ever was an actual Title ever sent. All I ever received from DMV in Ca was Registration with a replacement missing tag and what looked like Registration with it stating I am the owner. Electronic Title transfer, NOT THE TITLE. I called so many times trying to tell them I need my Title. Bottom line my car in impound and I can't get it WITHOUT TITLE OR RENEW CA REGISTRATION which is 300.00. I am on fixed income and car has been in impound since 4/1/2018. I have no means to pay for their screw up. They say doing what can, but unless they take responsibility for their screw up I just flushed 12268.74 down the drain. I have no car or the means to get anywhere. Also when asked Suzanne for copy of Sales Contract she sent a Registration card with the Ca address for the place that takes mail for homeless. They said call them, like they would hold that for 6 months, but I called and of course not there. She seems to have a problem with the difference between Registration, their Sales Contract, electronic Ca DMV Title transfer and what an actual AUTO TITLE  is.

Agreed on the specific car down to the stock number and price.  Have all the dialog and specific car cost breakdown in emails.  Upon giving my deposit, Ollie tried to change the car. Very unethical. I should have known when he tried to charge me to put air in the tires.  Started with Raymond, then Ollie then handed off to Ruby. Terrible system, Very Shady & Unethical.  Would not recommend. Typical car salesman crap and why people do not like dealing with car salesmen or buying a car.  I could still get the car but at the last minute, it was $700 more.  Very shady and crooked.  Do yourself a favor and buy elsewhere.  I actually did and purchased from Prescott Honda getting treated like a valued customer and saving money.  Purchased a 2018 at Prescott Honda for the same price Showcase wanted for a 2017 model.

a 2014 Ford Focus and it was having transmission issues (well known problem). I decided to shop around and after I drove the Accord Touring I knew I had found my new car. I looked at the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 as well as comparable sedans like the Camry and Mazda 6. At the end of the day, this car gives you great value and it looks so well made and handles like a dream. I would rather the top trim of this Accord than the bottom of a luxury brand. The features are phenomenal and it truly feels luxurious
