It is very hard to look for a used car that looks almost new! Well lets just say that if you do your research all dealers have extra fees even new car lots will try to sell you on warranties but I have to say that my salesperson Shaquille got me a great deal; even though I gave him a hard time negotiating but thats part of the game. Looking at the overall price couldnt find something close to it. Couldnt be happier with the service / financing options/ &amp; most important A QUALITY CAR. </p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2016<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX-L V-6<!-- --> with Tire Pressure Warning, Audio and cruise controls on steering wheel, Remote Start, Keyless Entry/Start, Stability Control<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->6<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>26<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->21<!-- --> City/<!-- -->34<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->03-15-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCR3F87GA013853" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCR3F87GA013853" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="752553" data-dealer-rooftop-id="4473" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2008 Honda Accord EX V-6 in Dark Blue" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2008/vin/1HGCP36768A049435/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/58-1hgcp36768a049435/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2008 Honda Accord EX V-6 in Dark Blue" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCP36768A049435" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2008/vin/1HGCP36768A049435/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2008<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX V-6</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(10, 21, 91)" title="Exterior Color: Royal Blue Pearl" aria-label="Exterior Color: Royal Blue Pearl"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch text-center unknown-color ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:transparent" title="Interior Color: Unknown" aria-label="Interior Color: Unknown"><span class="small d-block pos-r line-through"></span></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">119,877 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="0 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span></span> (<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->191553A</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$5,995</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

Of the dealers that responded they had not only the best price but the most complete email response.  All the others required me to call them to get the information included in the Huggins email to make an accurate comparison of the price.   In the end it didn&#x27;t matter because after all the calls were in Huggins had the best  price.  When we arrived at Huggins, we test drove the car we were buying, approved it, paid for it, had a short wait while the service department gave it a final tech check, washed and cleaned it and we were on our way.  Excellent and smooth transaction.

We had spoken several months ago about my desire to upgrade from my S60 T5. You knew I was especially wanting an AWD because of my driveway slope and my front wheel drive not always navigating it well in a sudden snow. When I stopped  in to have my car washed on 9/20/2019; you mentioned; “I have just the car for you. “ Tom, you were absolutely correct! Thank you for the time you spent familiarizing me with my new car; and as always for welcoming me to stop in anytime when there is a feature I am not quite grasping. Tom, that is why I will continue to purchase my vehicle from Byers Volvo; it’s just the best customer service in every aspect. And; as always your GM Mark was awesome too! </p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2017<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->LX<!-- --> with Tire Pressure Warning, Audio and cruise controls on steering wheel, Stability Control, Auto Climate Control, Trip Computer<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>30<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->27<!-- --> City/<!-- -->36<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->08-12-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCR2F35HA297743" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCR2F35HA297743" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="745118" data-dealer-rooftop-id="3430" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2008 Honda Accord EX-L in Dark Green" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2008/vin/1HGCP26888A004659/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/8f-1hgcp26888a004659/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2008 Honda Accord EX-L in Dark Green" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCP26888A004659" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2008/vin/1HGCP26888A004659/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2008<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX-L</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(68, 73, 60)" title="Exterior Color: Mystic Green Metallic" aria-label="Exterior Color: Mystic Green Metallic"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(0, 0, 0)" title="Interior Color: Black cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Black cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">125,403 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="4.45 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty2"></span></span> (<!-- -->53<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->39542A</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$5,900</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

He was very friendly and worked with me to get me a good car, even though I have no credit, no cosigner, and the minimum funds for a deposit. The process was quick and simple, saw a variety of nice and clean cars in person and with his help, and we were able to find a car that worked within my budget.  Thank you very much for the car buying experience, I will be sure to recommend this dealership to anyone that needs a car.</p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2008<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX-L<!-- --> with Tire Pressure Warning, Audio and cruise controls on steering wheel, Stability Control, Heated seats, Auto Climate Control<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>24<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->21<!-- --> City/<!-- -->31<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->04-23-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCP26888A004659" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCP26888A004659" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="756239" data-dealer-rooftop-id="11965" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2017 Honda Accord EX-L w/Navigation and Honda Sensing in Black" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2017/vin/1HGCT1B64HA000442/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/60-1hgct1b64ha000442/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2017 Honda Accord EX-L w/Navigation and Honda Sensing in Black" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCT1B64HA000442" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2017/vin/1HGCT1B64HA000442/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2017<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX-L w/Navigation and Honda Sensing</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(29, 29, 29)" title="Exterior Color: Crystal Black Pearl" aria-label="Exterior Color: Crystal Black Pearl"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(25, 25, 25)" title="Interior Color: Black leather" aria-label="Interior Color: Black leather"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">35,785 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="4.63 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty2"></span></span> (<!-- -->51<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->AH191708T</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$17,800</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

Being a very indecisive person, Jillian was the absolute best sales person to work with. I am not a practical man but did not feel pushed or pulled in any direction and she allowed me to make my vehicle selection with absolute no pressure. I took two days which felt great as nothing worse then to not feel like you can&#x27;t walk away to decide. Jillian communicated with me entire way, got both cars ready for me to decide and after the process, I walked away with great family vehicle (2016 Nissan Murano) that I absolute love. Definitely would return here and refer friends to purchase vehicle with this team!</p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2017<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->Touring V-6<!-- --> with Remote Start, Stability Control, Auto Climate Control, Adaptive Cruise Control, Power Driver Seat<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->6<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>25<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->21<!-- --> City/<!-- -->33<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->07-18-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCR3F90HA039074" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCR3F90HA039074" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="1817629" data-dealer-rooftop-id="1817628" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2016 Honda Accord LX w/Honda Sensing in Black" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2016/vin/1HGCR2F40GA076333/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/01-1hgcr2f40ga076333/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2016 Honda Accord LX w/Honda Sensing in Black" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCR2F40GA076333" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2016/vin/1HGCR2F40GA076333/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2016<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->LX w/Honda Sensing</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(29, 29, 29)" title="Exterior Color: Crystal Black Pearl" aria-label="Exterior Color: Crystal Black Pearl"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(25, 25, 25)" title="Interior Color: Black cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Black cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">62,511 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="0 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span></span> (<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->300097</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$11,986</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

I finally came across Great Lakes Honda. I drove an hour away just to come to this dealership and it was totally worth it. The atmosphere was nice and the waiting area was clean and cozy! From the internet sales team to the team at the store, everyone was so professional and great. Cristina, in the internet sales department, and Jeff Cox, the in store salesman, were so pleasant to work with! Both of them did their best to help my boyfriend and I out and we both left with the Civic Sport that day. Mr. Cox was very friendly. I got sick on the drive up and he accommodated to my needs and was so understanding about it. The communication was excellent! Any time I reached out, there was always a response and I didn&#x27;t have to wait days to get it!!

The previous dealerships I had visited reached out to me to see if I had found a car yet and I told them yes and that I was going to Great Lakes. I told them about the deal they were giving me (compared to the other dealerships trying to rip me off) and let me just say this, THEY WERE AT A LOSS OF WORDS. They couldn&#x27;t believe how much Great Lakes helped me. They actually tried to tell me that Great Lakes was going to low blow me when I got there to try to get me not to go. Can you believe that!  GREAT LAKES ACTUALLY VALUES THEIR CUSTOMERS AND WANTS NOTHING BUT SATISFACTION FOR THEM. 

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND anyone looking for a car to come here, even if you have to make a long drive to get there. It&#x27;s an experience you&#x27;ll never forget.

a 2014 Ford Focus and it was having transmission issues (well known problem). I decided to shop around and after I drove the Accord Touring I knew I had found my new car. I looked at the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 as well as comparable sedans like the Camry and Mazda 6. At the end of the day, this car gives you great value and it looks so well made and handles like a dream. I would rather the top trim of this Accord than the bottom of a luxury brand. The features are phenomenal and it truly feels luxurious
