With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without having to wrestle with a salesperson! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Accord is more than meets the eye. This Accord is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Sidney and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer&#x27;s remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn&#x27;t live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we&#x27;ll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase. Have a question about the car you&#x27;re looking at, or about the purchase process in general?

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without having to wrestle with a salesperson! Sometimes two doors is all you need. Combining the attractiveness of a weekend cruiser with almost all of the practicality of your neighbors sedan, this coupe will have you driving with pride! This Accord is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground.

Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Sidney and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer&#x27;s remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice.

I was approved thru my credit union at a lower rate than what Carvana offered and my credit union mailed me my check. Carvana sold the vehicle while I was processing my purchase and I ended up buying another truck locally at a dealer. On Black Friday I tried to give them another chance and tried to purchase a Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagen for my son. I filled out all the bank info with a $2000 deposit and the balance $12000 would come from my credit union. I signed all the paperwork online and scheduled a delivery date for 2 weeks later. 3 days after my online purchase, I kept getting texts stating that I would lose the $1000 Black Friday discount if they didn&#x27;t have a copy of my check from the credit union sent over to them by 8pm that evening. I had already provided Carvana with my credit union information, account, as well as authorized them to verify my fund for both the deposit and the balance. They stated some bogus &quot;guideline in underwriting,&quot; that this wasn&#x27;t enough. So I said no problem, in the morning, we can get on a 3 way call and speak to both my bank and my credit union and they can provide verification. They said unfortunately, the price would go up $1000 if this was the case as there was an expiration date on the black Friday discount. I even offered, a screen shot of my credit union account, showing my loan was already funded via a check and my first payment was due in January, but they still said this was not acceptable. It seems they make it hard for you to complete a transaction with a discount and wanted to revert back to a no discount transaction stating there was not enough time to verify funds (really? I didn&#x27;t set up delivery for 2 weeks exactly because I knew it would take time for my credit union to mail me a check). Their customer service rep Ally escalated the conversation to TJ her &quot;manager&quot; who was very smug and thought that when he strutted his &quot;manager&quot; title I would be impressed. I explained that I was buying from Carvana for the &quot;convenience and hassle free process they claim to have&quot; but yet will not hold a car even with a $2000 deposit for more than 24 hours unless you finance though them and since you are using a &quot;3rd party&quot; credit union (that has much lower rates than them for folks with great credit), their guidelines were different. To me it was simply a bait and switch, &quot;buy at this price one day but the price will change a few days later after they had extracted all your personal financial information. Never again. I requested they cancel my order. Their prices are the same as car dealerships and as much as some folks think dealerships are tough to deal with, Carvana employs people who know nothing about customer service. There is no advantage in buying from them than from a dealership. In fact I would much rather deal with real people whom I can evaluate if they are trustworthy and be able to choose to do business with them or not. The fact that they are an internet dealership only empowers them to hide in anonymity when they try to treat you unscrupulously. Do yourself a favor buy your next vehicle the old fashioned way, find someone who you can meet in person and trust. Buying a car are stressful to some, Carvana will only make you more stressful and offer no advantage in pricing or service. If this is how you are treated when you are trying to buy a vehicle from them, imagine what will happen if there is a problem with your car/truck! Poor service in the beginning will translate to worse service when you need it. I hope you read all the other negative reviews on Yelp and other rating sites and see Carvana for what it really is.</p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History

Also, the car is absolutely amazing and an excellent value. Fully equipped with all the safety features for a good price.

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without having to wrestle with a salesperson! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Accord is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Accord has a 8.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Accord is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can also avoid any issues with a lead foot by engaging the cruise control on this Accord. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Sidney and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer&#x27;s remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn&#x27;t live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we&#x27;ll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase.

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without having to wrestle with a salesperson! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Accord is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Accord has a 7.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Accord is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can also avoid any issues with a lead foot by engaging the cruise control on this Accord. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car.

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without having to wrestle with a salesperson! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Accord is more than meets the eye. This Accord is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Sidney and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer's remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn't live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we'll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase. Have a question about the car you're looking at, or about the purchase process in general?

I was approved thru my credit union at a lower rate than what Carvana offered and my credit union mailed me my check. Carvana sold the vehicle while I was processing my purchase and I ended up buying another truck locally at a dealer. On Black Friday I tried to give them another chance and tried to purchase a Volkswagen Jetta Sportwagen for my son. I filled out all the bank info with a $2000 deposit and the balance $12000 would come from my credit union. I signed all the paperwork online and scheduled a delivery date for 2 weeks later. 3 days after my online purchase, I kept getting texts stating that I would lose the $1000 Black Friday discount if they didn't have a copy of my check from the credit union sent over to them by 8pm that evening. I had already provided Carvana with my credit union information, account, as well as authorized them to verify my fund for both the deposit and the balance. They stated some bogus \"guideline in underwriting,\" that this wasn't enough. So I said no problem, in the morning, we can get on a 3 way call and speak to both my bank and my credit union and they can provide verification. They said unfortunately, the price would go up $1000 if this was the case as there was an expiration date on the black Friday discount. I even offered, a screen shot of my credit union account, showing my loan was already funded via a check and my first payment was due in January, but they still said this was not acceptable. It seems they make it hard for you to complete a transaction with a discount and wanted to revert back to a no discount transaction stating there was not enough time to verify funds (really? I didn't set up delivery for 2 weeks exactly because I knew it would take time for my credit union to mail me a check). Their customer service rep Ally escalated the conversation to TJ her \"manager\" who was very smug and thought that when he strutted his \"manager\" title I would be impressed. I explained that I was buying from Carvana for the \"convenience and hassle free process they claim to have\" but yet will not hold a car even with a $2000 deposit for more than 24 hours unless you finance though them and since you are using a \"3rd party\" credit union (that has much lower rates than them for folks with great credit), their guidelines were different. To me it was simply a bait and switch, \"buy at this price one day but the price will change a few days later after they had extracted all your personal financial information. Never again. I requested they cancel my order. Their prices are the same as car dealerships and as much as some folks think dealerships are tough to deal with, Carvana employs people who know nothing about customer service. There is no advantage in buying from them than from a dealership. In fact I would much rather deal with real people whom I can evaluate if they are trustworthy and be able to choose to do business with them or not. The fact that they are an internet dealership only empowers them to hide in anonymity when they try to treat you unscrupulously. Do yourself a favor buy your next vehicle the old fashioned way, find someone who you can meet in person and trust. Buying a car are stressful to some, Carvana will only make you more stressful and offer no advantage in pricing or service. If this is how you are treated when you are trying to buy a vehicle from them, imagine what will happen if there is a problem with your car/truck! Poor service in the beginning will translate to worse service when you need it. I hope you read all the other negative reviews on Yelp and other rating sites and see Carvana for what it really is."},{"thirdPartyInfo":{"priceValidation":{}},"vid":"31910A98DBEF0ACC46074AC1E10A4873","vin":"1HGCR2F84HA067638","stockNumber":"2000390366","type":"USED","sellersComments":"Got your eye on a 2017 Honda Accord that seats 5 and gets 36 MPG?

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without having to wrestle with a salesperson! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Accord is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Accord has a 8.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Accord is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can also avoid any issues with a lead foot by engaging the cruise control on this Accord. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car.

a 2014 Ford Focus and it was having transmission issues (well known problem). I decided to shop around and after I drove the Accord Touring I knew I had found my new car. I looked at the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 as well as comparable sedans like the Camry and Mazda 6. At the end of the day, this car gives you great value and it looks so well made and handles like a dream. I would rather the top trim of this Accord than the bottom of a luxury brand. The features are phenomenal and it truly feels luxurious
