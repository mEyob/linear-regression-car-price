I had to go find a salesman since there were none on the floor and apparently they were sitting outside smoking. I applied online for pre approval a day before and got notified to come on down to discuss my options. So I called first thing this morning and left a voicemail. I never recieved a call back. So I went down this afternoon and apparently they don&#x27;t offer online applications anymore, so I had to redo everything. The sales men on hand were so unprofessional and they were dressed pretty trashy too. The salesman Mitch, or &quot;Big Mitch&quot; as they call him. Just seemed so inpatient and un professional, like he didn&#x27;t have the time of day for me. So I left a note and walked out. I didn&#x27;t even get a handshake or offered a business card.
They had me sit for over an hour while they ran my credit and I was notified by company within 5 mins after he left to due so.</p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2013<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->Sport<!-- --> with Tire Pressure Warning, Audio and cruise controls on steering wheel, Stability Control, Auto Climate Control, Power Driver Seat<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>29<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->26<!-- --> City/<!-- -->35<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/></p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCR2F56DA283121" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCR2F56DA283121" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="1869851" data-dealer-rooftop-id="1869850" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2018 Honda Accord Sport in Dark Blue" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2018/vin/1HGCV1F38JA024081/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/79-1hgcv1f38ja024081/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2018 Honda Accord Sport in Dark Blue" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCV1F38JA024081" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2018/vin/1HGCV1F38JA024081/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2018<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->Sport</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(21, 20, 117)" title="Exterior Color: Still Night Pearl" aria-label="Exterior Color: Still Night Pearl"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(25, 25, 25)" title="Interior Color: Black leatherette/cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Black leatherette/cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">34,031 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="1 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span></span> (<!-- -->1<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->024081</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$20,999</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

After driving it back, I had my mechanic check out a minor squeak in the rear, after he took a look at it, the rear sub-frame was bent along with the control arm and would need to be replaced. The car was out of alignment and could not be adjusted back within specifications. The cost to repair was over $1,500 dollars. 
I spoke to the manager Winslow Walcott, and all he offered was to exchange the car for another car. I sent him the pictures where a shady repair was made along with the repair shop estimate. He denied they knew anything about the damage.
Peter Menke (Finance Manager) I caught several times feeding me false information about financing the car. 
I should have gone with my gut and walked away from this place, but getting a car for my daughter blurred my judgement and now I have to pay. Florida Fine Cars has not made much of an effort to correct the position they put me in. 
Dont make the same mistake I made and stay away from these extremely friendly [non-permissible content removed].

No issues with the vehicles, and a great experience at the dealership both times. Khalil and Kaisun were extremely professional, courteous, and fair. I am confident that I am going to receive a quality product and quality service when I go to Honda of Hackettstown.

I had to go find a salesman since there were none on the floor and apparently they were sitting outside smoking. I applied online for pre approval a day before and got notified to come on down to discuss my options. So I called first thing this morning and left a voicemail. I never recieved a call back. So I went down this afternoon and apparently they don't offer online applications anymore, so I had to redo everything. The sales men on hand were so unprofessional and they were dressed pretty trashy too. The salesman Mitch, or \"Big Mitch\" as they call him. Just seemed so inpatient and un professional, like he didn't have the time of day for me. So I left a note and walked out. I didn't even get a handshake or offered a business card.\r\nThey had me sit for over an hour while they ran my credit and I was notified by company within 5 mins after he left to due so."},{"thirdPartyInfo":{"priceValidation":{"cop":21110,"listPriceEstimate":22658,"evm":20413,"lowerbound":19609,"upperbound":21038,"dealType":"Great"}},"vid":"1065E44C55B923DBABDB3A6859F2712C","vin":"1HGCV1F38JA024081","stockNumber":"024081","type":"USED","sellersComments":"**TAKE ADVANTAGE OF OUR PUBLIC WHOLESALE PRICING GOING ON RIGHT NOW!!!**  **LIMITED POWER TRAIN WARRANTY FOR 30 DAYS OR 1000 MILES!!!

a 2014 Ford Focus and it was having transmission issues (well known problem). I decided to shop around and after I drove the Accord Touring I knew I had found my new car. I looked at the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 as well as comparable sedans like the Camry and Mazda 6. At the end of the day, this car gives you great value and it looks so well made and handles like a dream. I would rather the top trim of this Accord than the bottom of a luxury brand. The features are phenomenal and it truly feels luxurious
