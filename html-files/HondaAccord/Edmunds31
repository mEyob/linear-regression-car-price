This is my teenage daughter&#x27;s first car, so I was looking for something reliable, economical, and relatively inexpensive. The salesman, Denis Swift, was friendly, knowledgeable, and a perfect gentleman. The car is in fantastic condition, and I was very pleased with the price.</p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2018<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->Touring<!-- --> with Remote Start, Stability Control, Mobile Internet, Auto Climate Control, Adaptive Cruise Control<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>26<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->22<!-- --> City/<!-- -->32<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->08-09-2019</p></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="852790" data-dealer-rooftop-id="852789" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><a aria-label="2013 Honda Accord LX in Gray" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2013/vin/1HGCR2F37DA264480/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/69-1hgcr2f37da264480/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2013 Honda Accord LX in Gray" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCR2F37DA264480" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2013/vin/1HGCR2F37DA264480/?national=true">USED<!-- --> <!-- -->2013<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->LX</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(51, 59, 72)" title="Exterior Color: Modern Steel Metallic" aria-label="Exterior Color: Modern Steel Metallic"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(121, 121, 121)" title="Interior Color: Gray cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Gray cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">72,986 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="0 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty"></span></span> (<!-- -->0<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->264480</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$9,995</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

Place is very friendly, professional and Danny was very helpful and knowledgeable.

Make sure to go with at least 2 options in mind, do 1-2 test drive, plan your budget, see offers, fight prices and then be patient with the lease process.

I couldn’t be happier about my new lease through Keeler and how easy it all was. Adam is upfront but not pushy. He’s friendly, genuine and overall just excellent at what he does. His customer service far exceeded my expectations. He’s always so quick to respond, even on his days off! I am very pleased with my entire experience and absolutely love my new car. Highly recommend! </p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2017<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX<!-- --> with Blind Spot Monitoring, Tire Pressure Warning, Audio and cruise controls on steering wheel, Remote Start, Keyless Entry/Start<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>30<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->27<!-- --> City/<!-- -->36<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->Yes<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->08-27-2019</p></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="749962" data-dealer-rooftop-id="5254" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><span class="display-inline-block bg-primary-darker text-white rounded p-0_25 xsmall pill">Certified Pre-Owned</span><a aria-label="2018 Honda Accord Sport in Red" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2018/vin/1HGCV1F36JA174366/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/96-1hgcv1f36ja174366/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2018 Honda Accord Sport in Red" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCV1F36JA174366" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2018/vin/1HGCV1F36JA174366/?national=true">Certified<!-- --> <!-- -->2018<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->Sport</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(180, 0, 1)" title="Exterior Color: San Marino Red" aria-label="Exterior Color: San Marino Red"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(25, 25, 25)" title="Interior Color: Black leatherette/cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Black leatherette/cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">4,034 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="4.71 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-empty2"></span></span> (<!-- -->117<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->92162A</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$23,495</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

I purchased it from Sales Consultant David Quach. This was an internet purchase. I did not see or drive the vehicle until I arrived at the dealership after agreeing on a color combination, options and a price. I live in the Des Moines area about two hours from this dealership. After getting quotes from dealerships in 5 states David had the best price and he made it worth the two hour drive as price was the driving factor.  I had many interactions with him on the phone and via email. All were very positive. When we got to the dealership we test drove the Odyssey and he explained in detail all the features (and there are many). We were pleased with all the time he took to make sure we understood the features and knew how to use them. Further, he said he would send us, via email, videos that would be be beneficial if we forgot how to use something. True to his word we have received those videos. Everything was exactly as he said it would be when we arrived. The paper work was in order, the vehicle was clean inside and out (as it should be), and he answered all our questions. This was a great buying experience from beginning to end and I highly recommend David to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle. I have already recommended him to family and friends and shared our buying experience. I would definitely buy from him again. I hope this review helps you in some way.</p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and

I purchased it from Sales Consultant David Quach. This was an internet purchase. I did not see or drive the vehicle until I arrived at the dealership after agreeing on a color combination, options and a price. I live in the Des Moines area about two hours from this dealership. After getting quotes from dealerships in 5 states David had the best price and he made it worth the two hour drive as price was the driving factor.  I had many interactions with him on the phone and via email. All were very positive. When we got to the dealership we test drove the Odyssey and he explained in detail all the features (and there are many). We were pleased with all the time he took to make sure we understood the features and knew how to use them. Further, he said he would send us, via email, videos that would be be beneficial if we forgot how to use something. True to his word we have received those videos. Everything was exactly as he said it would be when we arrived. The paper work was in order, the vehicle was clean inside and out (as it should be), and he answered all our questions. This was a great buying experience from beginning to end and I highly recommend David to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle. I have already recommended him to family and friends and shared our buying experience. I would definitely buy from him again. I hope this review helps you in some way."}]},"facets":[{"type":"make","values":[{"name":"Acura","value":"acura"},{"name":"Alfa Romeo","value":"alfa-romeo"},{"name":"AM

a 2014 Ford Focus and it was having transmission issues (well known problem). I decided to shop around and after I drove the Accord Touring I knew I had found my new car. I looked at the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 as well as comparable sedans like the Camry and Mazda 6. At the end of the day, this car gives you great value and it looks so well made and handles like a dream. I would rather the top trim of this Accord than the bottom of a luxury brand. The features are phenomenal and it truly feels luxurious
