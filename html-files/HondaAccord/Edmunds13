He guided me and explained everything clearly. I felt like I was well taken care of and also felt good with my purchase. He was very kind and helpful.

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without ever stepping foot inside a dealership! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Accord is more than meets the eye. This Accord is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can also avoid any issues with a lead foot by engaging the cruise control on this Accord. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Sidney and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer&#x27;s remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn&#x27;t live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we&#x27;ll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase. Have a question about the car you&#x27;re looking at, or about the purchase process in general?

As one of my bank accounts was locked they had a hard time with funds transfer. not their fault. They worked with me over the phone and got everything solved. We wanted to see the jukebox in Phoenix. Interesting but Ill have it delivered next time. Everyone I worked with at Carvana was super friendly and helpful.  Now after having the car a few days my short wife was struggling with blind spots and wasn&#x27;t comfy with the car. They came and picked it up...that simple. I will say that the condition of the vehicle was about perfect. I was sad to see it go and I would definitively use Carvana for any additional purchase. We have been looking at used cars locally also and the quality of what i see at dealers for similar price doesnt compare.</p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History

I was in a very expensive lease that I easily could afford when I got into it.  Given my financial situation I thought when my lease was up I would need to buy a car outright cash and not be able to get something even remotely comparable to my 2017 BMW.  I got a letter from Conicelli saying they could help, I figured a phone call couldn&#x27;t hurt.  Although my options were someone limited they got me into a very comparable vehicle a 2016 Audi, low mileage and cut my monthly expense in half.  I worked with Rohan and my sales rep and Vlad for the financing.  Both went above and beyond to make something work for me.  I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone even if your an hour away.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the drive.  Not once did I feel like I was being looked down upon given the financial troubles that I had run into.</p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Features and Specs:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Description: <!-- -->Used<!-- --> <!-- -->2018<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX-L w/Navi<!-- --> with Remote Start, Stability Control, Mobile Internet, Auto Climate Control, Adaptive Cruise Control<!-- -->.<br/>Engine: <!-- -->4<!-- -->-cylinders <br/>Transmission: <!-- -->Automatic<!-- --> <br/>Drive Wheel Configuration: <!-- -->front wheel drive<!-- --> <br/>33<!-- --> Combined MPG (<!-- -->30<!-- --> City/<!-- -->38<!-- --> Highway)</p><p class="small font-weight-bold">Listing Information:</p><p class="xsmall mb-1">Certified Pre-Owned: <!-- -->No<!-- --> <br/>Listed since: <!-- -->09-02-2019</p></div></div><div class="srp-card-compare-select pos-r w-100" data-tracking-id=""><div class="compare-select"><div class="checkbox custom compare-checkbox d-flex align-items-center text-gray-darker size-14 rounded px-0_75 mt-0_5 w-100"><input type="checkbox" id="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCV1F61JA177959" autoComplete="off" data-hidedelightedoninteraction="true" class="custom-input m-0 form-check-input"/><label for="checkbox-compare-checkbox-1HGCV1F61JA177959" class="label-container m-0 compare-label w-100"><div class="custom-label rounded"></div><div class="text-label pl-1_5">Compare</div></label></div></div></div></li><li data-tracking-id="srp_view_vin_details" data-dealer-franchise-id="755695" data-dealer-rooftop-id="12521" data-tracking-value="vehicle_card_click" class="search-results-inventory-card no-gutters list-unstyled bg-white mb-0_75 mb-lg-1 srp-vehicle-card hover row"><div class="srp-card-photo col-12 col-md-5"><div class="search-results-inventory-card-photo pos-r h-100"><span class="display-inline-block bg-primary-darker text-white rounded p-0_25 xsmall pill">Certified Pre-Owned</span><a aria-label="2016 Honda Accord EX in Dark Red" class="d-block" rel="nofollow" href="/honda/accord/2016/vin/1HGCR2F74GA226776/?national=true"><figure class="image-wrapper m-0"><img data-test="image" src="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/for-sale/43-1hgcr2f74ga226776/img-1-400x175.jpg" alt="2016 Honda Accord EX in Dark Red" class="image img-fluid"/></figure></a><div class="photo-shadow text-right top w-100"><span class="authorization-disabled" style="opacity:0.5;pointer-events:none"><button class="heart-button text-zdepth-1 mb-0 p-0_5 icon-heart4" data-tracking-id="vin_sign_up_progress" data-tracking-value="1HGCR2F74GA226776" data-subaction-name="save_vin" title="Click to save" aria-label="Click to save"></button></span></div><div class="photo-shadow bottom w-100"></div></div></div><div role="button" class="px-0_5 px-md-1 pt-1 pt-md-0_5 d-flex flex-column justify-content-between srp-text-decoration-none col-12 col-md-7"><div class="srp-card-info row"><div class="text-left d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-7"><div class="text-gray-darker"><a rel="nofollow" class="d-block h5 mb-0" href="/honda/accord/2016/vin/1HGCR2F74GA226776/?national=true">Certified<!-- --> <!-- -->2016<!-- --> <!-- -->Honda<!-- --> <!-- -->Accord<!-- --> <!-- -->EX</a><div class="disclaimer mb-0_25 mb-md-0 mt-0_5 mt-md-0_25"><div class="d-inline-block mr-0_5 small">Ext:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(109, 42, 49)" title="Exterior Color: Basque Red Pearl II" aria-label="Exterior Color: Basque Red Pearl II"></span> </span></div><div class="d-inline-block mr-md-1 small">Int:<span><span class="color-swatch ml-0_25 rounded d-inline-block align-text-top" style="background-color:rgb(156, 141, 128)" title="Interior Color: Ivory cloth" aria-label="Interior Color: Ivory cloth"></span> </span></div><div class="d-block d-md-inline-block mt-0 small">Mileage:<span class="text-gray-darker ml-0_25">33,421 miles</span></div></div></div><div class="d-inline-block align-bottom"><div class="d-inline-block"><div class="text-gray-darker"><span class="small">Dealer: </span><span class="disclaimer"><span class="rating-stars no-ml text-success" aria-label="5 out of 5 stars"><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span><span class="rating-star icon-star-full"></span></span> (<!-- -->11<!-- -->)</span></div></div><div data-test="stock-number" class="disclaimer">Stock# <!-- -->13797</div></div></div><div class="text-right d-flex flex-column justify-content-between col-6 col-md-5"><div class="srp-card-price"><div class="d-flex justify-content-end align-items-baseline"><div class="mr-0_5 text-gray-dark small">List</div><h3 class="mb-0 text-gray-darker">$15,995</h3></div><div class="small text-gray-dark">Est.

I was welcomed by Amy Brent, who guided me through the process, and we quickly agreed on a price.  Then I went to the dealership and Amy entrusted me to Daryl Beattie, who was informed and solicitous and trustworthy, and within a short time I was signing papers to buy a new 2018 Honda Civic.

It was a pleasant and efficient system, and I left quite satisfied.</p><p class="text-gray-dark small font-weight-bold">AutoCheck Vehicle History Summary Unavailable.</p><p class="small

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without having to wrestle with a salesperson! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Accord is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Accord has a 7.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Accord is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can cover miles with ease with available cruise control. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Sidney and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer&#x27;s remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice. If the car doesn&#x27;t live up to your expectations for any reason within the 7-day period, give us a call and we&#x27;ll come retrieve the vehicle from you with a refund of your purchase. Have a question about the car you&#x27;re looking at, or about the purchase process in general?

I declined to buy. They sent it to their body shop fixed the crushed roof and repainted the car. Their website says nothing of the damage. I called and they said they dont have to report it. The car will never be the same.
Carvana is selling damaged cars and not telling you!

With Carvana, you can get this high-quality, Carvana Certified vehicle without having to wrestle with a salesperson! While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Accord is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Accord has a 7.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Accord is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. Before making them available to you, we ensure that every Carvana vehicle is accident-free before putting it through an exhaustive reconditioning and detailing process. Take a 360-degree virtual tour - inside and out - of every vehicle in our inventory, as we detail every feature and any major imperfections that appear on the car. This particular car has passed a rigorous 150-point inspection by Sidney and his talented team of ASE Certified mechanics. Worried about buyer&#x27;s remorse with your online vehicle purchase? Worry no more, as every vehicle purchase comes with a 7-day test-own, allowing you to drive around town and even have the vehicle inspected by a mechanic of your choice.

While sedans are the most common vehicle out there, this Accord is more than meets the eye. As an added bonus, this Accord has a 8.00 out of 10 EPA Greenhouse Score! This score is reserved for only the cleanest of vehicles and not only implies great fuel economy but also some of the lowest carbon dioxide emissions among all vehicles. This Accord is also equipped with a FWD layout. The simplicity of this layout lowers cost and actually improves traction since the heavy engine pushes the driven wheels onto the ground. You can also avoid any issues with a lead foot by engaging the cruise control on this Accord. Safely communicate with friends and family using the Bluetooth hands-free calling.

I was in a very expensive lease that I easily could afford when I got into it.  Given my financial situation I thought when my lease was up I would need to buy a car outright cash and not be able to get something even remotely comparable to my 2017 BMW.  I got a letter from Conicelli saying they could help, I figured a phone call couldn't hurt.  Although my options were someone limited they got me into a very comparable vehicle a 2016 Audi, low mileage and cut my monthly expense in half.  I worked with Rohan and my sales rep and Vlad for the financing.  Both went above and beyond to make something work for me.

a 2014 Ford Focus and it was having transmission issues (well known problem). I decided to shop around and after I drove the Accord Touring I knew I had found my new car. I looked at the BMW 3 series and Audi A4 as well as comparable sedans like the Camry and Mazda 6. At the end of the day, this car gives you great value and it looks so well made and handles like a dream. I would rather the top trim of this Accord than the bottom of a luxury brand. The features are phenomenal and it truly feels luxurious inside.","userName":"Elliot","createDate":"04-22-2019","modelYear":"2019","styleId":"401779176","thumbsUp":32,"userRating":5,"reviewExperienceSource":"OWNER"}],"totalReviewCount":1026,"averageConsumerRatings":4.2,"starRatingCount":{"oneStarRatingCount":40,"twoStarRatingCount":49,"threeStarRatingCount":136,"fourStarRatingCount":227,"fiveStarRatingCount":574}}},"attributes":{"vehicle":{"make":{"id":200001444,"name":"Honda","niceId":"honda"},"model":{"name":"Accord","modelLinkCode":"M030277","niceId":"accord"}},"inventoryType":"USED,CPO","sort":"boostControl5National:DESC","paymentType":"loan","sentient":{},"radius":6000}},"$partial":true,"adTargeting":{"$partial":true,"model":{"$partial":true,"accord":{"currentVehicle":null,"customTargeting":null}}}},"nativeAdsCreativeConfig":{"$partial":true,"adName":{"$partial":true,"srp-native-ad":{"$partial":true,"platform":{"$partial":true,"wired":{"$partial":true,"model":{"$partial":true,"accord":{"$partial":true,"year":{"$partial":true,"any":{"srp-native-ad":[{"id":"0d2cca43bd6e821f52f1e0640792c42c17bb512ca3079dcdd391bcf256738beb","name":"srp-native-ad","traffickingData":{"clickTracker":{"desktop":"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8821.2990.EDMUNDS.COMINC/B22474094.252311663;dc_trk_aid=439926874;dc_trk_cid=113991234;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=?https://automobiles.honda.com/tools/current-offers?zipcode=%%PATTERN:zip%%&vehiclemodelseries=accord-sedan","tablet":"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8821.2990.EDMUNDS.COMINC/B22474094.252311663;dc_trk_aid=439926874;dc_trk_cid=113991234;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=?https://automobiles.honda.com/tools/current-offers?zipcode=%%PATTERN:zip%%&vehiclemodelseries=accord-sedan","mobile":"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N8821.2990.EDMUNDS.COMINC/B22474094.252311663;dc_trk_aid=439926874;dc_trk_cid=113991234;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=?https://automobiles.honda.com/tools/current-offers?zipcode=%%PATTERN:zip%%&vehiclemodelseries=accord-sedan"}},"creativeConfigData":{"creativeConfigId":"0d2cca43bd6e821f52f1e0640792c42c17bb512ca3079dcdd391bcf256738beb","lineItemId":"5128556320","creativeId":"native_srp_ret_v1","productSku":"WND017","disclaimerCopy":"","cta":"View
